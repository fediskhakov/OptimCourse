## Sequences and limits in $\mathbb{R}^K$

```{admonition} Definition: sequence
:class: caution

A ***sequence*** $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^K$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{R}^K$

```

```{admonition} Definition: Euclidean norm
:class: caution

The (Euclidean) ***norm*** of ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is defined as
%
$$
%
\| {\bf x} \| 
:= \sqrt{{\bf x}' {\bf x} } 
= \left( \sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 \right)^{1/2}
%
$$
%
```

Interpretation:
%
- $\| {\bf x} \|$ represents the _length_ of ${\bf x}$
- $\| {\bf x} - {\bf y} \|$ represents distance between ${\bf x}$ and ${\bf y}$

When $K=1$, the norm $\| \cdot \|$ reduces to $|\cdot|$

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^K$ called ***bounded*** if 
%
$$
%
\exists \, M \in \mathbb{R} 
\; \mathrm{such\;that} \;
\|{\bf x}\| \leq M, \quad \forall \; {\bf x} \in A
%
$$
%
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

For $\epsilon > 0$, the $\epsilon$-ball $B_{\epsilon}({\bf a})$ around
${\bf a} \in \mathbb{R}^K$ is all ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^K$ such that $\|{\bf a} - {\bf x}\|
< \epsilon$
```

```{figure} _static/plots/eps_ball2D.png
:name: eps_ball2D
:scale: 50%
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If ${\bf x}$ is in every $\epsilon$-ball around ${\bf a}$ then
${\bf x}={\bf a}$
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If ${\bf a} \ne {\bf b}$, then $\exists \, \epsilon > 0$ such that 
$B_\epsilon({\bf a}) \cap B_\epsilon({\bf b}) = \emptyset$
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Sequence $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ is said to ***converge*** to ${\bf a} \in \mathbb{R}^K$ if
%
$$
%
\forall \epsilon > 0, 
\;
\exists \, N \in \mathbb{N}
\; 
\text{ such that } n \geq N \implies {\bf x}_n \in B_{\epsilon}({\bf a})
%
$$
%

```

We say: "$\{{\bf x}_n\}$ is eventually in any $\epsilon$-neighborhood of ${\bf a}$"

In this case ${\bf a}$ is called the ***limit*** of the sequence, and we write
%
$$ 
%
{\bf x}_n \to {\bf a} \; \text{ as } \; n \to \infty
\quad \text{or} \quad
\lim_{n \to \infty} {\bf x}_n = {\bf a}
%
$$
%

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

We call $\{ {\bf x}_n \}$ ***convergent*** if it converges to some limit in $\mathbb{R}^K$

```

```{figure} _static/plots/convergence.png
:name: convergence

:name: convergence2
:scale: 80%
```

```{figure} _static/plots/convergence3.png
:name: convergence3
:scale: 80%
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

A sequence $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^K$ converges to ${\bf a} \in \mathbb{R}^K$
if and only if each component sequence converges in $\mathbb{R}$ 

That is,
%
$$
%
\begin{pmatrix}
x^1_n \\
\vdots \\
x^K_n 
\end{pmatrix}
\to
\begin{pmatrix}
a^1 \\
\vdots \\
a^K 
\end{pmatrix}
\quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^K
\quad \iff \quad
\begin{array}{cc}
x^1_n \to a^1 & \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R} \\
\vdots & \\
x^K_n \to a^K & \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R} 
\end{array}
%
$$
% Equivalent:
%
$$
% {\bf x}_n \to {\bf a} \; \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^K
% \quad \iff\quad 
% {\bf e}_k' {\bf x}_n \to {\bf e}_k' {\bf a} \text{ in $\mathbb{R}$ for all } k
%
$$

## Open and Closed Sets

Let $G \subset \mathbb{R}^K$

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

We call ${\bf x} \in G$ ***interior*** to $G$ if 
$\exists \; \epsilon > 0$ with $B_\epsilon({\bf x}) \subset G$

```

Loosely speaking, interior means "not on the boundary"

```{figure} _static/plots/interior.png
:name: interior
:scale: 50%
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

If $G = (a, b)$ for some $a < b$, then any $x \in (a, b)$ is interior 
```
```{figure} _static/plots/x_interior.png
:name: x_interior
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Fix any $a < b$ and any $x \in (a, b)$

Let $\epsilon := \min\{x - a, b - x\}$

If $y \in B_\epsilon(x)$ then $y < b$ because 
%
$$
%
y 
= y + x - x
\leq |y - x| + x
< \epsilon + x 
\leq b - x + x = b
%
$$
%

````

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

If $G = [-1, 1]$, then $1$ is not interior 
```

```{figure} _static/plots/not_interior.png
:name: not_interior
```

Intuitively, any $\epsilon$-ball centered on $1$ will contain points $> 1$

More formally, pick any $\epsilon > 0$ and consider $B_\epsilon(1)$

There exists a $y \in B_\epsilon(1)$ such that $y \notin [-1, 1]$

For example, consider the point $y := 1 + \epsilon/2$

**Exercise:** Check this point: lies in $B_\epsilon(1)$ but not in $[-1, 1]$

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A set $G\subset \mathbb{R}^K$ is called ***open*** if all of its points are interior 

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Open sets:

- any "open" interval $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$, since we showed all points are interior
- any "open" ball $B_\epsilon({\bf a}) = {\bf x} \in
\mathbb{R}^K : \|{\bf x} - {\bf a} \| < \epsilon$
- $\mathbb{R}^K$ itself
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Sets that are not open

- $(a,b]$ because $b$ is not interior 
- $[a,b)$ because $a$ is not interior 
```

### Closed Sets

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A set $F \subset \mathbb{R}^K$ is called ***closed*** if every convergent sequence in $F$ converges to a point in $F$

```

Rephrased: If $\{{\bf x}_n\} \subset F$ and ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$ for some
${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^K$, then ${\bf x} \in F$

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

All of $\mathbb{R}^K$ is closed because every sequence converging to a point in $\mathbb{R}^K$ converges to a point in $\mathbb{R}^K$... right?
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

If $(-1, 1) \subset \mathbb{R}$ is {\bf not} closed
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

True because
%
1. $x_n := 1-1/n$ is a sequence in $(-1, 1)$ converging to $1$,
9. and yet $1 \notin (-1, 1)$

````

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

If $F = [a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ then $F$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}$
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Take any sequence $\{x_n\}$ such that
%
- $x_n \in F$ for all $n$
- $x_n \to x$ for some $x \in \mathbb{R}$

We claim that $x \in F$

Recall that (weak) inequalities are preserved under limits:

- $x_n \leq b$ for all $n$ and $x_n \to x$, so $x \leq b$
- $x_n \geq a$ for all $n$ and $x_n \to x$, so $x \geq a$
%
therefore $x \in [a, b] =: F$

````

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Any "hyperplane" of the form 
%
$$
%
H = \{ {\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^K : {\bf x}' {\bf a} = c \}
%
$$ 
%
is closed 
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Fix ${\bf a} \in \mathbb{R}^K$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $H$ be as above

Let $\{{\bf x}_n\} \subset H$ with ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^K$

We claim that ${\bf x} \in H$

Since ${\bf x}_n \in H$ and ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$ we have 
%
$$
%
{\bf x}_n ' {\bf a} \to {\bf x}' {\bf a} \text{ in } \mathbb{R}
\quad \text{and} \quad
{\bf x}_n' {\bf a} = c \text{ for all } n
%
$$
%
$$
%
\text{therefore } 
{\bf x}' {\bf a} = \lim_{n} {\bf x}_n' {\bf a} 
= \lim_n c
= c
%
$$
%
$$
%
\text{therefore } 
{\bf x} \in H
%
$$
%
````

### Properties of Open and Closed Sets

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

$G \subset \mathbb{R}^K$ is open $\iff \; G^c$ is closed
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

$\implies$ 

First prove necessity

Pick any $G$ and let $F := G^c$

Suppose to the contrary that $G$ is open but $F$ is not closed, so 
%
$\exists$ a sequence $\{{\bf x}_n\} \subset F$ with limit ${\bf x} \notin F$ 

Then ${\bf x} \in G$, and since $G$ open, $\exists \, \epsilon > 0$ such
that $B_\epsilon({\bf x}) \subset G$

Since ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$ we can choose an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with ${\bf x}_N \in
B_\epsilon({\bf x})$

This contradicts ${\bf x}_n \in F$ for all $n$

$\Longleftarrow$ 

Next prove sufficiency

Pick any closed $F$ and let $G := F^c$, need to prove that $G$ is open

Suppose to the contrary that $G$ is not open

Then exists some non-interior ${\bf x} \in G$, that is no $\epsilon$-ball around $x$ lies entirely in $G$

Then it is possible to find a sequence $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ which converges to $x \in G$, but every element of which lies in the $B_{1/n}({\bf x}) \cap F$

This contradicts the fact that $F$ is closed
````

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Any singleton $\{ {\bf x} \} \subset \mathbb{R}^K$ is closed
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Let's prove this by showing that $\{{\bf x}\}^c$ is open

Pick any ${\bf y} \in \{{\bf x}\}^c$

We claim that ${\bf y}$ is interior to $\{{\bf x}\}^c$

Since ${\bf y} \in \{{\bf x}\}^c$ it must be that ${\bf y} \ne {\bf x}$

Therefore, exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $B_\epsilon({\bf y}) \cap B_\epsilon({\bf x}) = \emptyset$

In particular, ${\bf x} \notin B_\epsilon({\bf y})$, and hence $B_\epsilon({\bf y}) \subset \{{\bf x}\}^c$

Therefore ${\bf y}$ is interior as claimed

Since ${\bf y}$ was arbitrary it follows that $\{{\bf x}\}^c$ is open and $\{{\bf x}\}$ is closed

````

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

1. Any *union* of open sets is open
9. Any *intersection* of closed sets is closed
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

*Proof of first fact:*

Let $G := \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} G_\lambda$, where each $G_\lambda$ is
open

We claim that any given ${\bf x} \in G$ is interior to $G$

Pick any ${\bf x} \in G$

By definition, ${\bf x} \in G_\lambda$ for some $\lambda$

Since $G_\lambda$ is open, $\exists \, \epsilon > 0$ such that $B_\epsilon({\bf x})
\subset G_\lambda$

But $G_\lambda \subset G$, so $B_\epsilon({\bf x}) \subset G$ also holds

In other words, ${\bf x}$ is interior to $G$ 

````

But be careful: 

- An **infinite** intersection of open sets is not necessarily open
- An **infinite** union of closed sets is not necessarily closed

For example, if $G_n := (-1/n, 1/n)$, then $\cap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} G_n = \{0\} $ 

To see this, suppose that $x \in \cap_n G_n$

Then
%
$$
%
-1/n < x < 1/n, \quad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
%
$$
%
Therefore $x = 0$, and hence $x \in \{0\}$ 

On the other hand, if $x \in \{0\}$ then $x \in \cap_n G_n$

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $A$ is closed and bounded then every sequence in
$A$ has a subsequence which converges to a point of $A$
``` 

Take any sequence $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ contained in $A$

Since $A$ is bounded, $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ is bounded

Therefore it has a convergent subsequence

Since the subsequence is also contained in $A$, 
and $A$ is closed, the limit must lie in $A$.

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Bounded and closed sets are called **compact sets** or **compacts**

```

## Continuity

One of the most fundamental properties of functions

Related to existence of 

- optima
- roots
- fixed points
- etc

as well as a variety of other useful concepts

### Reminder on functions >>

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A ***function*** $f \colon A \rightarrow B$ from set $A$ to set $B$ is a rule that
associates to *each* element of $A$ a *uniquely determined* element of $B$
```

```{figure} _static/plots/function.png
:name: function
```

$A$ is called the ***domain*** of $f$ and $B$ is called the ***codomain***

```{figure} _static/plots/allfunctions.png
:name: function_non_function
:scale: 50%

```
Lower panel: functions have to map *all* elements in domain to a *uniquely determined* element in codomain.

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

The smallest possible codomain is called the ***range*** of $f \colon A \to B$:

```
%
$$
%
\mathrm{rng}(f) := \{ b \in B : f(a) = b \text{ for some } a \in A \} 
%
$$
%

```{figure} _static/plots/range.png
:name: range
:scale: 50%
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A function $f \colon A \to B$ is called ***onto*** (or surjection) if every element of $B$
is the image under $f$ of at least one point in $A$. 

A function $f \colon A \to B$ is called ***one-to-one*** (or injection) if distinct
elements of $A$ are always mapped into distinct elements of $B$.

A function that is both one-to-one (injection) and onto (surjection) is called a ***bijection*** or ***one-to-one correspondence***
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $f \colon A \to B$ is one-to-one, then $f \colon A \to \mathrm{rng}(f)$ is a bijection

```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $f \colon A \to B$ a bijection, then there exists a unique
function $\phi \colon B \to A$ such that 
%
$$
%
\phi(f(a)) = a, \quad \forall \; a \in A
%
$$
%

That function $\phi$ is called the ***inverse*** of $f$ and written $f^{-1}$
```

```{figure} _static/plots/bijec.png
:name: bijec

```

### Bounded functions

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A function $F$ is called ***bounded*** if its range is a bounded set.

```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $F$ and $G$ are bounded, then so are $F+G$, $F \cdot G$ and $\alpha F$ for any finite $\alpha$
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Proof for the case $F + G$:

Let $F$ and $G$ be bounded functions 

$\exists$ $M_F$ and $M_G$ s.t.
$\| F({\bf x}) \| \leq M_F$ and $\| G({\bf x}) \| \leq M_G$
for all ${\bf x}$

Fix any ${\bf x}$ and let $M := M_F + M_G$ 

Applying the triangle inequality gives
%
$$
%
\| (F + G)({\bf x}) \|
:= \| F({\bf x}) + G({\bf x}) \|
\leq \| F({\bf x}) \| + \| G({\bf x}) \| 
\leq M
%
$$
%
Since ${\bf x}$ was arbitrary this bound holds for all ${\bf x}$

````

### Continuous functions

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Let $F \colon A \to \mathbb{R}^J$ where $A$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^K$.
$F$ is called ***continuous at*** ${\bf x} \in A$ if as $n \to \infty$
%
$$
%
{\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}
\quad \implies \quad
F({\bf x}_n) \to F({\bf x}) 
%
$$
%
```

Requires that 

- $F({\bf x}_n)$ converges for each choice of ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$,
- The limit is always the same, and that limit is $F({\bf x})$

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

$F$ is called ***continuous*** if it is continuous at every ${\bf x} \in
A$

```

```{figure} _static/plots/cont_func.png
:name: cont_func2

Continuity
```

```{figure} _static/plots/discont_func.png
:name: discont_func2

Discontinuity at $x$
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Let ${\bf A}$ be an $J \times K$ matrix and let $F({\bf x}) = {\bf A}
{\bf x}$

The function $F$ is continuous at every ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^K$
```

To see this take 
%
- any ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^K$ 
- any ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$

By the definition of the matrix norm $\| {\bf A} \|$, we have
%
$$
%
\| {\bf A} {\bf x}_n - {\bf A} {\bf x} \|
= \| {\bf A} ({\bf x}_n - {\bf x}) \|
\leq \| {\bf A} \| \| {\bf x}_n - {\bf x} \|
%
$$
%
$$
%
\text{therefore }
{\bf x}_n \to {\bf x} \implies
{\bf A} {\bf x}_n \to {\bf A} {\bf x} 
%
$$
%

***Exercise:*** Exactly what rules are we using here?

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $x$, then $f$ is continuous at $x$
```

%**Proof:** Suppose to the contrary that $f$ discontinuous at $x$

%Then exists $x_n \to x$ with $f(x_n) \nrightarrow f(x)$

%We can and do choose $\{x_n\}$ such that $x_n \ne x$ for all $n$

%Since $f(x_n) \nrightarrow f(x)$, exists $\epsilon > 0$ s.t. $|f(x_n) - f(x)| \geq \epsilon$
%infinitely often

%Letting $h_n := x_n - x$, we have
%%%
$$
%\frac{f(x + h_n) - f(x)}{h_n} 
%= 
%\frac{f(x_n) - f(x)}{x_n - x} 
%%
$$
%

%This sequence fails to converge to any constant (why?)

%

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Some functions known to be continuous on their domains:

%
- $x \mapsto x^\alpha$
- $x \mapsto |x|$
- $x \mapsto \log(x)$
- $x \mapsto \exp(x)$
- $x \mapsto \sin(x)$
- $x \mapsto \cos(x)$
%
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Discontinuous at zero: $x \mapsto \mathbb{1}\{x > 0\}$.

```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Let $F$ and $G$ be functions and let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$

%
1. If $F$ and $G$ are continuous at ${\bf x}$ then so is $F + G$,
where
%
$$
%
(F + G)({\bf x}) := F({\bf x}) + G({\bf x})
%
$$
%

2. If $F$ is continuous at ${\bf x}$ then so is $\alpha F$, where
%
$$
%
(\alpha F)({\bf x}) := \alpha F({\bf x})
%
$$
%

3. If $F$ and $G$ are continuous at ${\bf x}$ and real valued then so is
$FG$, where
%
$$
%
(FG)({\bf x}) := F({\bf x}) \cdot G({\bf x})
%
$$ 
%
In the latter case, if in addition $G({\bf x}) \ne 0$, then $F/G$ is also continuous.

```

As a result, set of continuous functions is "closed" under elementary
arithmetic operations

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

The function $F \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by
%
$$
%
F(x) = \frac{\exp(x) + \sin(x)}{2 + \cos(x)} + \frac{x^4}{2}
- \frac{\cos^3(x)}{8!}
%
$$
%
is continuous
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Just repeatedly apply the rules on the previous slide

Let's just check that 
%
$$
%
\text{$F$ and $G$ continuous at ${\bf x}$}
\implies 
\text{$F + G$ continuous at ${\bf x}$}
%
$$
%

Let $F$ and $G$ be continuous at ${\bf x}$

Pick any ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$

We claim that 
$F({\bf x}_n) + G({\bf x}_n) \to F({\bf x}) + G({\bf x})$

By assumption, $F({\bf x}_n) \to F({\bf x})$ and $G({\bf x}_n) \to G({\bf x})$

From this and the triangle inequality we get
%
$$
%
\| F({\bf x}_n) + G({\bf x}_n) - (F({\bf x}) + G({\bf x})) \|
\leq 
%
$$
%
$$
%
\leq 
\| F({\bf x}_n) - F({\bf x}) \|
+
\| G({\bf x}_n) - G({\bf x}) \|
\to 0
%
$$

## Suprema and Infima ($\mathrm{sup}$ + $\mathrm{inf}$)

In the introductory lecture we have seen a few simple examples of optimization problems. Like in many introductory econ/finance cources
we get well behaved, prepackaged problems.

Usually they 
- have a solution
- the solution is unique and not hard to find

However, for the *majority* of problems such properties aren't guaranteed

We need some idea of how to check these things

Consider the problem of finding the "maximum" or "minimum" of a function

A first issue is that such values might not be well defined

Recall that the set of maximizers/minimizers can be 
- empty
- a singleton (contains one element)
- infinite (contains infinitely many elements)

```{code-cell} python3
:tags: [hide-cell]

from myst_nb import glue
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def subplots():
    "Custom subplots with axes through the origin"
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    # Set the axes through the origin
    for spine in ['left', 'bottom']:
        ax.spines[spine].set_position('zero')
    for spine in ['right', 'top']:
        ax.spines[spine].set_color('none')
    return fig, ax

xmin, xmax = 0, 1
xgrid1 = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 100)
xgrid2 = np.linspace(xmax, 2, 10)

fig, ax = subplots()
ax.set_ylim(0, 1.1)
ax.set_xlim(-0.0, 2)
func_string = r'$f(x) = x^2$ if $x < 1$ else $f(x) = 0.5$'
ax.plot(xgrid1, xgrid1**2, 'b-', lw=3, alpha=0.6, label=func_string)
ax.plot(xgrid2, 0 * xgrid2 + 0.5, 'b-', lw=3, alpha=0.6)
#ax.legend(frameon=False, loc='lower right', fontsize=16)
glue("fig_none", fig, display=False)

```

````{admonition} Example: no maximizers
:class: tip

The following function has no maximizers on $[0, 2]$

$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
x^2 &  \text{ if } x < 1
\\
1/2 &  \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

```{glue:figure} fig_none
:width: 80%
:align: center

No maximizer on $[0, 2]$
```

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$.
A number $u \in \mathbb{R}$ is called an ***upper bound*** of $A$ if 
%
$$
%
a \leq u \quad \text{for all} \quad a \in A
%
$$
%

```

```{admonition} Example

If $A = (0, 1)$ then 1 is an upper bound of $A$

- If $A = (0, 1) \cup (2, 3)$, then $U(A) = [3, \infty)$
- If $A = \mathbb{N}$, then $U(A) = \emptyset$

```

```{admonition} Definition

The *least upper bound* of $A$ is called ***supremum*** of $A$.

In other words, if $s$ is a number satisfying
%
$$
%
s \in U(A)
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
s \leq u, \; \forall \, u \in U(A)

% 
then $s$ is the ***supremum*** of $A$ and we write $s = \sup A$

A set $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ is called ***bounded above*** if $U(A)$ is not empty

```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $A$ is nonempty and bounded above then $A$ has a supremum in $\mathbb{R}$
```

- Equivalent to the fact that all Cauchy sequences converge 

- Same principle: $\mathbb{R}$ has no "gaps" or "holes"

What if $A$ is not bounded above, so that $U(A) = \emptyset$?

We follow the convention that $\sup A := \infty$ in this case

Now the supremum of a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ **always** exists


```{note}
Aside: Conventions for dealing with symbols "$\infty$'' and ``$-\infty$"

If $a \in \mathbb{R}$, then


- $a + \infty = \infty$
- $a - \infty = -\infty$
- $a \times \infty = \infty$ if $a \ne 0$, $0 \times \infty = 0$
- $-\infty < a < \infty$
- $\infty + \infty = \infty$
- $-\infty - \infty = -\infty$

But $\infty - \infty$ is not defined

### Maxima and Minima of Sets

In optimization we're mainly interested in maximizing and minimizing functions

%
$$
%
\max_{{\bf x} \in A} f({\bf x})
%
$$
%

As we'll see, the problem is the same as finding the largest number in the **range of** $f$

That is, the largest number **in the set**
%
$$
f(A) := \{ f({\bf x}) \colon {\bf x } \in A\}
$$
%

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

We call $a^*$ the ***maximum*** of $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ and write $a^* = \max A$ if
%
$$
%
a^* \in A 
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
a \leq a^*
\text{ for all } 
a \in A

$$
%

```

```{admonition} Example

If $A = [0, 1]$ then $\max A = 1$
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

We call $a^*$ the ***minimum*** of $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ and write $a^* = \min A$ if
%
$$
%
a^* \in A

a^* \leq a
\text{ for all } 
a \in A

If $A = [0, 1]$ then $\min A = 0$

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ is finite then $\max A$ and $\min A$ always exist

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

- $\max\{2, 4, 6, 8\} = 8$
- $\min\{2, 4, 6, 8\} = 2$

%Some facts about max and min for pairs:
%
%```{admonition} Fact
%:class: important
%
%For any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a \in \mathbb{R}_+ := [0, \infty)$, we have
%
%- $x + y = x \vee y + x \wedge y$
%- $|x - y| = x \vee y - x \wedge y$
%- $|x - y| = x + y - 2 (x \wedge y)$
%- $|x - y| = 2 ( x \vee y) -x -y$
%- $a(x \vee y) = (ax ) \vee (ay)$
%- $a(x \wedge y) = (ax ) \wedge (ay)$
%
%```
%

%Let's prove that $x + y = x \vee y + x \wedge y$

%Pick any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$

%Suppose first that $x \leq y$

%Then 
%
%
% $$x \vee y + x \wedge y = y + x$$
%

%Suppose instead that $x > y$

%Then 
% 
%
% $$x \vee y + x \wedge y = x + y$$

```{admonition} Fact

For infinite subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, max and min may not exist!

### Relationship between max/min and sup/inf

When max and min exist they agree with sup and inf

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Let $A$ be any subset of $\mathbb{R}$
1. If $\sup A \in A$, then $\max A$ exists and $\max A = \sup A$
9. If $\inf A \in A$, then $\min A$ exists and $\min A = \inf A$
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Proof of case 1: Let $a^* := \sup A$ and suppose $a^* \in A$

We want to show that $\max A = a^*$

Since $a^* \in A$, we need only show that $a \leq a^*$ for all $a \in A$

This follows from $a^* = \sup A$, which implies $a^* \in U(A)$

````

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $F \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a closed and bounded, then 
$\max F$ and $\min F$ both exist

```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Proof for the max case:

Since $F$ is bounded, 

- $\sup F$ exists 

- $\exists$ a sequence $\{x_n\} \subset F$ with $x_n \to \sup F$

Since $F$ is closed, this implies that $\sup F \in F$

Hence $\max F$ exists and $\max F = \sup F$

````

%

%Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^K$, let $F \colon A \to \mathbb{R}^J$ and let $K \subset A$

%```
%also closed and bounded

%

%\begin{figure}
%\scalebox{.4}{\includegraphics{compact_image.pdf}}
%\end{figure}

%

%

%Proof: Let $F$ and $K$ be as specified

%

%We claim every sequence in $F(K)$ has a subsequence converging
%to a point in $F(K)$

%

%Let $\{{\bf y}_n\} \subset F(K)$ 

%By definition, we can take $\{{\bf x}_n\} \subset K$ with $F({\bf x}_n) = {\bf y}_n$ for each $n$

%Since $K$ compact, $\exists$ subsequence $\{{\bf x}_{n_k}\}$ with ${\bf x}_{n_k} \to {\bf x} \in K$

%By continuity of $F$ we have $F ({\bf x}_{n_k}) \to F ({\bf x})$

%Since ${\bf x} \in K$ we have $F ({\bf x}) \in F(K)$ 

%In summary, ${\bf y}_{n_k} = F ({\bf x}_{n_k}) \to$ a point in $K$

## Existence of optima for functions

Now we turn to suprema and infima, maxima and minima (extrema) for functions

This is not a new concept --- it's just about extrema of sets --- but the sets are the **range** of functions

In particular
%
- The sup of a function $f$ is just the sup of its range
- The max of a function $f$ is just the max of its range

Througout we use the notation
%
$$
f(A) := \{ f({\bf x}) \colon {\bf x } \in A\}
$$
%

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Let $f \colon A \to \mathbb{R}$, where $A$ is any set 

The ***supremum of $f$ on $A$*** is defined as
%
$$
%
\sup_{{\bf x} \in A} f({\bf x}) 
:= \sup f(A)
%
$$
%

The ***infimum of $f$ on $A$*** is defined as
% 
%
$$
%
\inf_{{\bf x} \in A} f({\bf x})

The ***maximum*** of $f$ on $A$ is defined as 
%
$$
%
\max_{{\bf x} \in A} f({\bf x}) 
:= \max f(A)
%
$$
%

The ***minimum*** of $f$ on $A$ is defined as

$$

```{admonition} Definition

A ***maximizer*** of $f$ on $A$ is a point ${\bf a}^* \in A$ such that

%
or equivalently 
%
$$
{\bf a}^* \in A \text{ and } f({\bf a}^*) \geq f({\bf x}) \text{ for all
} {\bf x} \in A

%

```


The set of all maximizers is typically denoted by 
%
$$\mathrm{argmax}_{{\bf x} \in A}f({\bf x})$$
%

```{admonition} Definition

### Weierstrass extreme value theorem

```{admonition} Fact (Weierstrass extreme value theorem)
:class: important

If $f$ is continuous and $A$ is closed and bounded, then $f$ has both a maximizer and a minimizer in $A$.

```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Sketch:
- can show under the assumptions that $f(A)$ is closed and bounded
- proof uses Bolzano--Weierstrass theorem, details omitted

````

Hence the max of $f(A)$ exists, and we can write
%
$$
%
M^* := \max f(A) := \max \{ f({\bf x}) \colon {\bf x } \in A\}
%
$$
%

The point ${\bf x}^* \in A$ such that $f({\bf x}^*) = M^*$ is a maximizer

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Consider the problem
%
$$ 
%
\max_{c_1, c_2} \; U(c_1, c_2) := \sqrt{c_1} + \beta \sqrt{c_2} 
%
$$
%

%
$$
%
\text{ such that } \; c_2 \leq (1 + r)(w - c_1), 
\quad c_i \geq 0 \text{ for } i = 1,2
%
$$
%
where
%
- $r=$ interest rate, $w=$ wealth, $\beta=$ discount factor
- all parameters $> 0$ 
```

Let $B$ be all $(c_1, c_2)$ satisfying the constraint

**Exercise:** Show that the budget set $B$ is a closed, bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$

**Exercise:** Show that $U$ is continuous on $B$

We conclude that a maximizer exists

### Properties of Optima

We now state some useful facts regarding optima

Sometimes we state properties about sups and infs rather than max and min --- this is so we don't have to keep saying "if it exsits"

But remember that if it does exist then the same properties apply: if a max exists, then it's a sup, etc.

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $A \subset B$ and $f \colon B \to \mathbb{R}$, then
%
$$
%
\sup_{{\bf x} \in A} f({\bf x}) \leq \sup_{{\bf x} \in B} f({\bf x})
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\inf_{{\bf x} \in A} f({\bf x}) \geq \inf_{{\bf x} \in B} f({\bf x})
%
$$
%
```

```{figure} _static/plots/sup_ab_func.png
:name: 

```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Proof, for the sup case: 

Let $A$, $B$ and $f$ be as in the statement of the fact

We already know that $C \subset D \implies \sup C \leq \sup D$

Hence it suffices to show that $f(A) \subset f(B)$, because then
%
$$
%
\sup_{{\bf x} \in A} f({\bf x}) 
:= \sup f(A)
\leq \sup f(B) 
=: \sup_{{\bf x} \in B} f({\bf x})
%
$$
%

To see that $f(A) \subset f(B)$, take any $y \in f(A)$

By definition, $\exists \, {\bf x} \in A$ such that $f({\bf x}) = y$

Since $A \subset B$ we must have ${\bf x} \in B$ 

So $f({\bf x}) = y$ for some ${\bf x} \in B$, and hence $y \in f(B)$

Thus $f(A) \subset f(B)$ as was to be shown

x_i > 0 \text{ and } p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 \leq m
\right\}
%
$$
%
Thus, we solve
%
$$
%
\max_{{\bf x} \in B(m)} U({\bf x})
%

Clearly $m \leq m' \implies B(m) \subset B(m')$

Hence the maximal value goes up as $m$ increases

%

We have data for $n = 1, \ldots, N$ individuals

Successful regression is often associated with large $R^2$ 

- A measure of "goodness of fit"

Large $R^2$ occurs when we have a small sum of squared residuals

{\rm ssr}_a := 
\min_{\alpha, \beta} 
\; \sum_{n=1}^N \, (y_n - \alpha - \beta x_n)^2

%
$$
%
{\rm ssr}_b :=

\; \sum_{n=1}^N \, (y_n - \alpha - \beta x_n - \gamma z_n)^2

## Concavity and uniqueness of optima

Uniqueness of optima is directly connected to convexity / concavity

- Convexity is a shape property for sets

- Convexity and concavity are shape properties for functions

However, only one fundamental concept: convex sets

### Convex Sets

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A set $C \subset \mathbb{R}^K$ is called ***convex*** if
%
$$
%
{\bf x}, {\bf y} \text{ in } C \text{ and } 0 \leq \lambda \leq 1
\; \implies \;
\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y} \in C
%
$$

```

Remark: This is vector addition and scalar multiplication

Convexity $\iff$ line between any two points in $C$ lies in $C$

{\bf e}_k' {\bf z}$

Since 
%
- $z_k = \lambda x_k + (1 - \lambda) y_k$
- $x_k \geq 0$ and $y_k \geq 0$

It is clear that $z_k \geq 0$ for all $k$

### Concave Functions

### Preservation of Shape

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^K$ be convex and let $f$ and $g$ be functions from $A$
to $\mathbb{R}$

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $f$ and $g$ are convex (resp., concave) and $\alpha \geq 0$, then
%
- $\alpha f$ is convex (resp., concave)
- $f + g$ is convex (resp., concave)
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $f$ and $g$ are strictly convex (resp., strictly concave) and $\alpha > 0$, then
%
- $\alpha f$ is strictly convex (resp., strictly concave)
- $f + g$ is strictly convex (resp., strictly concave)
```

Let's prove that $f$ and $g$ convex $\implies h := f + g$ convex

Pick any ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in A$ and $\lambda \in [0, 1]$

We have
%
$$
%
& 
h(\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y})
= f(\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y})
+ g(\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y})
\\ &
\leq 
\lambda f({\bf x}) + (1 - \lambda) f({\bf y})
+
\lambda g({\bf x}) + (1 - \lambda) g({\bf y})
\\ &
=
\lambda [f({\bf x}) + g({\bf x})]
+ (1 - \lambda) [f({\bf y}) + g({\bf y})]
\\ &
=
\lambda h({\bf x}) + (1 - \lambda) h({\bf y})

%

Hence $h$ is convex


## Uniqueness of Optimizers


```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^K$ be convex and let $f \colon A \to \mathbb{R}$

1. If $f$ is strictly convex, then $f$ has at most one minimizer on $A$

9. If $f$ is strictly concave, then $f$ has at most one maximizer on $A$

```


Interpretation, strictly concave case:

- we don't know in general if $f$ has a maximizer

- but if it does, then it has exactly one

- in other words, we have uniqueness

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Proof for the case where $f$ is strictly concave:

Suppose to the contrary that 
%
- ${\bf a}$ and ${\bf b}$ are distinct points in $A$

- both are maximizers of $f$ on $A$

By the def of maximizers, $f({\bf a}) \geq f({\bf b})$ and $f({\bf b}) \geq f({\bf a})$

Hence we have $f({\bf a}) = f({\bf b})$

By strict concavity, then
%
$$
%
f\left( \frac{1}{2} {\bf a} + \frac{1}{2} {\bf b} \right)
> \frac{1}{2} f( {\bf a}) + \frac{1}{2} f( {\bf b})
= \frac{1}{2} f( {\bf a}) + \frac{1}{2} f( {\bf a})
= f({\bf a})
%
$$
%

This contradicts the assumption that ${\bf a}$ is a maximizer

````

### A Sufficient Condition

We can now restate more precisely optimization results stated in the
introductory lectures

Let $f \colon A \to \mathbb{R}$ be a $C^2$ function where $A \subset \mathbb{R}^K$
is open, convex

Recall that ${\bf x}^* \in A$ is a stationary point of $f$ if
%
$$
%
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} 
f({\bf x}^*)
= 0
\quad \text{for all $i$ in } 1, \ldots, K
%
$$
%

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $f$ and $A$ are as above and ${\bf x}^* \in A$ is stationary, then
%
1. $f$ strictly concave $\implies$ ${\bf x}^*$ is the unique maximizer of $f$ on $A$

2. $f$ strictly convex $\implies$ ${\bf x}^*$ is the unique
minimizer of $f$ on $A$
