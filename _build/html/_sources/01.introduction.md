# Introduction

Course title: **"Optimization for Economics and Financial Economics"**

- Elective second year course in the *Bachelor of Economics* program ECON2125
- Compulsory second math course in the *Master of Economics* program ECON6012

The two courses are identical in content and assessment, but final grades may be adjusted depending on your program.

## Instructor

**Fedor Iskhakov**
Professor of Economics at RSE

> I’m an applied micro-econometrician and a computational economist working in the field of structural estimation of dynamic models of individual and strategic choice, with applications to labor economics, public economics, durable goods markets, household finance, applied industrial organization and dynamic games.

- sufficient lecture notes
- downloadable as markdown or pdf
- GitHub based
- submit issues and typos through the provided button
- **Latest version of the notes a day before the lecture**
- check for the updates in the morning

## How tutorials will be conducted?

- practical exercises 
- posted with the corresponding lecture
- try to solve the exercises before the tutorial
- exercises solved and discussed at the tutorial
- **participation is not mandatory but highly recommended**
- if you solve all tutorial excesses, you will be able to solve all practical problems in the exams
- solutions posted a week after

**Tutorials start on week 2**


## Course prerequisites

See [Course overview](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/course/ECON2125#terms) and
[Class summary](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/ECON2125/Second%20Semester/6275)

What you actually need to know:
- basic algebra
- basic calculus
- some idea of what a matrix is, etc.

≈ content of EMET1001/EMET7001 math courses

## Focus?

*Q:* Is this optimization or a general math-econ course?

*A:* Optimization will be an important and recurring theme, but the course has a lot more material on general mathematical modeling for economics.

## Assessments

*See [home page](https://optim.iskh.me/00.index.html#assessment)*

## Where to send your questions

1. Administrative questions: RSE admin

  - **Bronwyn Cammack** Senior School Administrator
  - Email: enquiries.rse@anu.edu.au

  - "I can not register for the tutorial group"

2. Content related questions: please, refer to the tutors

  - "I don't understand why this function is convex"

3. Other questions: to Fedor

  - "I'm working hard but still can not keep up"
  - "Can I please have extra assignment for more practice"

## Attendance

- please, **do not** use email for *instructional* questions

- instead make use of the office hours

- attendance of tutorials is *very highly* recommended\
You will make your life much easier this way

- attendance of lectures is *highly* recommended\
But not mandatory

## Comments for lectures notes/slides

- Cover exactly what you are required to know
- Code inserts are the exception, they are not assessable

In particular, you need to know:
- The definitions from the notes
- The facts from the notes
- How to apply facts and definitions

If a concept in not in the lecture notes, it is not assessable

## Definitions and facts

The lectures notes/slides are full of definitions and facts.

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is called *continuous at* $x$ if, for any sequence $\{x_n\}$ converging to $x$, we have $f(x_n) \rightarrow f(x)$.
```

Possible exam question: "Show  that if functions $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $x$, so is $f+g$."

You should start the answer with the definition of continuity: 

"Let $\{x_n\}$ be any sequence converging to $x$. We need to show that $f(x_n) + g(x_n) \rightarrow f(x) + g(x)$. To see this, note that ..."

## Facts

In the lecture notes/slides you will often see

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important
The only $N$-dimensional subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ is $\mathbb{R}^N$.
```
This means either:
- theorem
- proposition
- lemma
- true statement

All well known results. You need to remember them, have some intuition for, and be able to apply.

## Note on Assessments

Assessable = definitions and facts + last year level math + a few simple steps of logic

Exams and tests will award:
- Hard work
- Deeper understanding of the concepts

In each question there will be a *easy* path to the solution

## Reading materials

**Primary reference:** lecture slides

**Books:**

- "Mathematics for Economists" (1994) by Simon, C. and L. Blume
- "A First Course in Optimization" (1996) Theory by Rangarajan Sundaram
- "A Primer in Econometric Theory" (2016) by John Stachurski

- readings are supplementary but will provide a more detailed explanation with additional examples.
- each lecture will reference book chapters

## Key points for the administrative part

- Tutorials start next week, **please register before the next lecture**
- Course content = what’s in lecture notes/slides
- Lecture slides are available online and will be updated throughout the semester
- Optimization is a recurring theme but not the only topic

## What you will learn in the course

*See [home page](https://optim.iskh.me/00.index.html)*

## Further material and self-learning

- Each lecture will suggest some material for further reading and learning

- Today: **The Wason Selection Task** logical problem

- Mathematics relies on rules of logic
- Yet, for human brain applying mathematical logic may be difficult, and dependent on the domain

- Further learning: [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/iR97LBgpsl8) on Wason selection task
