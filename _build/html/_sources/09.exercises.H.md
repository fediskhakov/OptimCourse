# Exercise set H

Following the invited lecture (which will not appear in the final exam) this week's tutorial focuses again on the type of problems that will likely appear in the final exam.

## Question H.1

Find the maxima and minima of the function $f(x,y) = xy$ subject to $x^2+y^2=2a^2$, where $a>0$.

```{hint}
Checking both first _and_ second order conditions if necessary for the top grade at the exam
```

## Question H.2

Find the maxima and minima of the function $f(x,y) = \tfrac{1}{x} + \tfrac{1}{y}$ subject to $(\tfrac{1}{x})^2+(\tfrac{1}{y})^2=(\tfrac{1}{a})^2$, where $a>0$.

## Question H.3

Solve the following maximization problem
%
$$
xy^{\tfrac{1}{2}}z^{\tfrac{1}{3}} \longrightarrow max_{x,y,z}
\\
\text{ subject to }\\
x \ge 0, y \ge 0 ,z \ge 0,
3x + 2y + z \le 10\\
%
$$
