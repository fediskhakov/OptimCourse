**Supplementary reading:**
- Simon & Blume: 
- Sundaram: 

```{admonition} Common symbols
- $P \implies Q$ means "$P$ implies $Q$"
- $P \iff Q$ means "$P \implies Q$ and $Q \implies P$"
- $\exists$ means "there exists"
- $\forall$ means "for all"
- s.t. means "such that"
- $\because$ means "because" (not used very often)
- $\therefore$ means "therefore" (not used very often)
- $a := 1$ means "$a$ is defined to be equal to 1" (alternatively $a \equiv 1$ or 
$a \stackrel{def.}{=} 1 $)
- $\mathbb{R}$ means all real numbers
- $\mathbb{N}$ means the natural numbers $\{1, 2, \ldots \}$
- $\mathbb{Z}$ means integers $\{\ldots, -2,-1,0,1, 2, \ldots \}$
- $\mathbb{Q}$ means the rational numbers (ratios of two integers)
```

## Logic

Let $P$ and $Q$ be statements, such as 
%
- $x$ is a negative integer
- $x$ is an odd number
- the area of any circle in the plane is $-2 \pi R$

[Law of the excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle): Every mathematical statement is either `true` or `false`

Statement "$P \implies Q$" means "$P$ implies $Q$"

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$k$ is even $\implies$ $k = 2n$ for some integer $n$
```

Equivalent forms of $P \implies Q$:
%
1. If $P$ is true then $Q$ is true
2. $P$ is a *sufficient condition* for $Q$
3. $Q$ is a necessary condition for $P$
9. If $Q$ fails then $P$ fails


```{figure} _static/plots/subset.png
:name: subset
:scale: 50%
```

Equivalent ways of saying $P \nRightarrow Q$ (*does not imply*):
%
1. $P$ does not imply $Q$
2. $P$ is not sufficient for $Q$
3. $Q$ is not necessary for $P$
9. Even if $Q$ fails, $P$ can still hold

```{figure} _static/plots/notsubset.png
:name: notsubset
:scale: 50%
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Let 
%
- $P := $ "$n \in \mathbb{N}$ and even"
- $Q := $ "$n$ even"

Then 
%
1. $P \implies Q$
2. $P$ is sufficient for $Q$
3. $Q$ is necessary for $P$ 
9. If $Q$ fails then $P$ fails
```



```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Let 
%
- $P := $ "$R$ is a rectangle"
- $Q := $ "$R$ is a square"


Then 
%
1. $P \not \Rightarrow Q$
2. $P$ is not sufficient for $Q$
3. $Q$ is not necessary for $P$ 
9. Just because $Q$ fails does not mean that $P$ fails
```


## Proof by contradiction

Suppose we wish to prove a statement such as $P \implies Q$

1. A proof by contradiction starts by **assuming the opposite**: $P$ holds and yet $Q$ fails.

2. We then show that this scenario leads to a contradiction

```{admonition} Examples of contradictions
:class: tip

- $1 < 0$
- $10$ is an odd number

```

We then conclude that $P \implies Q$ is valid after all.





```{admonition} Example: proof by contradiction
:class: tip

Suppose that island X is populated only by pirates and knights:

- pirates always lie
- knights always tell the truth

Claim to prove: If person Y says `"I'm a pirate"` then person Y is ***not*** a native of island X
```


Strategy for the **Proof:** 

1. Suppose person Y is a native of the island
2. Show that this leads to a contradiction
9. Conclude that Y is not a native of island X, as claimed

**Proof:**
Suppose to the contrary that person Y ***is*** a native of island X

- then Y is either a pirate or a knight

1. Suppose first that Y is knight

- Y is a knight who claims to be a pirate
- This is impossible, since knights always tell the truth

2. Suppose next that Y is pirate

- Y is a pirate who claims to be a pirate
- Since pirates always lie, they would not make such a statement

Either way we get a contradiction $\implies$ Y is not a native of the island!




```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

There is ***no*** $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $0 < x < 1/n$, $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$.

```


**Proof:** Suppose to the contrary that such an $x$ exists

```{figure} _static/plots/no_x.png
:name: no_x
```

Since $x > 0$ the number $1/x$ is finite

Let $k$ be the smallest integer such that $k \geq 1/x$

- if $x = 0.3$ then $1/x = 3.333\cdots$, so set $k = 4 \in \mathbb{N}$
- if $x = 0.02$ then $1/x = 50\cdots$, so set $k = 50 \in \mathbb{N}$

Since $k \geq 1/x$ we also have $1/k \leq x$

On the other hand, since $k \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $x < 1/k$

But then $1/k \leq x < 1/k$, and in particular $1/k < 1/k$, which is impossible --- a contradiction!


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Show that $n^2$ odd $\implies$ $n$ odd
```

**Proof:** Suppose to the contrary that is:

1. $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n^2$ is odd
9. but $n$ is even


Then $n = 2k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$

Hence $n^2 = (2k)^2$ 

But then $n^2 = 2m$ for $m := 2k^2 \in \mathbb{N}$, and thus $n^2$ is even!

Contradiction




## Sets

Will often refer to the ***real numbers***,  $\mathbb{R}$

Understand it to contain "all of the numbers" on the "real line"

```{figure} _static/plots/real_line.png
:name: real_line
```

Contains both the rational and the irrational numbers

$\mathbb{R}$ is an example of a ***set***

A set is a collection of objects viewed as a whole

(In case of $\mathbb{R}$, the objects are numbers)  

Other examples of sets:

- set of all rectangles in the plane
- set of all prime numbers
- set of students in the class

Notation: 

- Sets: $A, B, C$
- Elements: $x,y,z$

Important sets: 

- $\mathbb{N} := \{1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$
- $\mathbb{Z} := \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}$
- $\mathbb{Q} := \{ p/q : p, q \in \mathbb{Z}, \; q \ne 0 \}$
- $\mathbb{R} := \mathbb{Q} \cup \{ \text{ irrationals } \}$

```{admonition} Definition of a set
:class: caution

A set $A$ can be defined by either

- direct enumeration of its elements
- defining a formula for infinite number of elements
- as a *subset* of already defined set $B$ and known function $\psi(x)$
%
$$
A = \{ \psi(x), x \in B \colon \text{condition on x}\}
$$
```

## Intervals of $\mathbb{R}$

Common notation:
%
$$
(a, b)  := \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b \}
$$
$$
(a, b]  := \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x \leq b \}
$$
$$
[a, b)  := \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : a \leq x < b \}
$$
$$
[a, b]  := \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : a \leq x \leq b \}
$$
$$
[a, \infty) := \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : a \leq x  \}
$$
$$
(-\infty, b) := \{ x \in \mathbb{R} :  x < b  \}
$$

Etc.


## Operations with sets

Let $A$ and $B$ be any sets

Statement $x \in A$ means that $x$ is an element of $A$

$A \subset B$ means that any element of $A$ is also an element of $B$

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

- $\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z}$
- irrational numbers are a subset of $\mathbb{R}$

```

***Equality*** of $A$ and $B$ 

Let $S$ be any set and $A$ and $B$ be subsets of $S$

$A = B$ means that $A$ and $B$ contain the same elements 

Equivalently, $A = B$ $\iff$ $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$


***Union*** of $A$ and $B$ 
%
$$
A \cup B := 
\{ x \in S : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}
$$

***Intersection*** of $A$ and $B$
%
$$
A \cap B := 
\{ x \in S : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}
$$
%

***Set theoretic difference*** of $A$ and $B$
%
$$
A \setminus B := 
\{ x \in S : x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B \}
$$
%

In other words, all points in $A$ that are not points in $B$


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

- $\mathbb{Z} \setminus \mathbb{N} = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0\}$
- $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q} = $ the set of irrational numbers
- $\mathbb{R} \setminus [0, \infty) = (-\infty, 0)$
- $\mathbb{R} \setminus (a, b) = (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty)$
```


***Complement*** of $A$ 

All elements of $S$ that are not in $A$:
%
$$
A^c := S \setminus A :=: \{ x \in S : x \notin A \}
$$
%

Remarks: 

- Need to know what $S$ is before we can determine $A^c$
- If not clear better write $S \setminus A$


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$(a,\infty)^c$ generally understood to be $(-\infty, a]$ 
```



```{figure} _static/plots/allsets.png
:name: allsets

\label{f:allsets} Unions, intersections and complements
```

## Set operations properties


If $A$ and $B$ subsets of $S$, then
%
1. $A \cup B = B \cup A$ and $A \cap B = B \cap A$
- $(A \cup B)^c = B^c \cap A^c$ and $(A \cap B)^c = B^c \cup A^c$
- $A \setminus B = A \cap B^c$
9. $(A^c)^c = A$
%


The ***empty set*** $\emptyset$ is the set containing no elements

If $A \cap B = \emptyset$, then $A$ and $B$ said to be ***disjoint***




## Infinite Unions and Intersections

Given a family of sets $K_{\lambda} \subset S$ with $\lambda \in \Lambda$, 

$$
\bigcap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} K_{\lambda} 
:= \{ x \in S : x\in K_{\lambda}
\textnormal{ for all } \lambda \in \Lambda \}
$$
$$
\bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} K_{\lambda}  
:= \{x \in S \colon \textnormal{there
exists an } \lambda \in \Lambda \textnormal{ such that } x\in K_{\lambda} \}
$$


- "there exists" means "there exists ***at least*** one"


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Let $A := \cap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (0, 1/n)$

Claim: $A = \emptyset$ 

```



**Proof:** We need to show that $A$ contains no elements

Suppose to the contrary that $x \in A = \cap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (0, 1/n)$

Then $x$ is a number satisfying $0 < x < 1/n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ 

No such $x$ exists as we showed above. Contradiction.


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

For any $a < b$ we have $\cup_{\epsilon > 0 } \; [a + \epsilon, b) = (a, b)$ 
```

**Proof:** To show equality of the sets, we show that RHS $\subset$ LHS and LHS $\subset$ RHS

Pick any $a < b$ 

Suppose first that $x \in \cup_{\epsilon > 0 } \; [a + \epsilon, b)$

This means there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $a + \epsilon \leq x < b$

Clearly $a < x < b$, and hence $x \in (a, b)$

Conversely, if $a < x < b$, then $\exists \, \epsilon > 0$ s.t. $a +
\epsilon \leq x < b$

Hence $x \in \cup_{\epsilon > 0 } \; [a + \epsilon, b)$

```{admonition} Fact: de Morgan's laws
:class: important

Let $S$ be any set and let $K_{\lambda} \subset S$ for all $\lambda \in \Lambda$. Then 

$$
\left[ \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} K_{\lambda}  \right]^{c}  =
\bigcap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} K_{\lambda}^{c}
\quad \text{and} \quad
\left[ \bigcap_{\lambda \in \Lambda}
K_{\lambda}  \right]^{c}  = \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} K_{\lambda}^{c}
$$

```



Let's prove that $A := \left( \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} K_{\lambda}  \right)^{c}
= \cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} K_{\lambda}^{c} =: B$

Suffices to show that $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$  

Let's just do  $A \subset B$

Must show that every $x \in A$ is also in $B$

Fix $x \in A$ 

Since $x \in A$, it must be that $x$ is not in $\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} K_{\lambda}$

$$
\text{therefore } \text{ $x$ is not in any $K_{\lambda}$ }
$$
%
$$
\text{therefore } x \in K_{\lambda}^c \text{ for each } \lambda \in \Lambda
$$
%
$$
\text{therefore } x \in \cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} K_{\lambda}^{c} =: B
$$




## Tuples

We often organize collections with natural order into "tuples"

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A ***tuple*** is 
%
- a finite ordered sequence of terms
- denoted using notation such as $(a_1, a_2)$ or $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Flip a coin 10 times and let

- $0$ represent tails and $1$ represent heads


Typical outcome $(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1)$

Generic outcome $(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{10})$  for $b_n \in \{0, 1\}$
```


## Cartesian Products

We make collections of tuples using Cartesian products

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

The ***Cartesian product*** of $A_1, \ldots, A_N$ is the set
%
$$
A_1 \times \cdots \times A_N
:= \{ (a_1, \ldots, a_N) : a_n \in A_n \text{ for } n =1, \ldots, N \}
$$
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$$
```[0, 8] \times [0, 1] = \{ (x_1,x_2) : 0 \leq x_1 \leq 8, \, 0 \leq x_2 \leq 1 \}
$$
```
```{figure} _static/plots/cart_prod.png
:name: cart_prod
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Set of all outcomes from flip experiment is
```
%
$$
B := \Big\{ (b_1, \ldots, b_{10}) : b_n \in \{0, 1\} \text{ for } n = 1, \ldots, 10 \Big\}
$$
$$
= \{0, 1\} \times \cdots \times \{0, 1\} \quad (10 \text{ products})
$$

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

The ***vector space*** $\mathbb{R}^N$ is the Cartesian product
%
$$
\mathbb{R}^N = \mathbb{R} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{R} \quad (N \text{ times})
$$
$$
= \{ 
\, \text{all tuples } (x_1, \ldots, x_N) \text{ with } x_n \in \mathbb{R}
\}
$$

```

## Counting Finite Sequences 

Counting methods answer common questions such as

- How many arrangements of a sequence?
- How many subsets of a set?


They also address deeper problems such as 

- How "large" is a given set?
- Can we compare size of sets even when they are infinite?


The key rule is: multiply possibilities

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Can travel from Sydney to Tokyo in 3 ways and Tokyo to NYC in 8 ways
$\implies$ can travel from Sydney to NYC in 24 ways
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Number of 10 letter passwords from the lowercase letters `a,b,...,z` is
$$
26^{10} = 141,167,095,653,376
$$
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Number of possible distinct outcomes $(i, j)$ from 2 rolls of a dice is
$$
6 \times 6 = 36
$$
```

## Counting Cartesian Products 

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $A_n$ are finite for $n=1, \ldots,N$, then 
%
$$
\#(A_1 \times \cdots \times A_N) = (\# A_1) \times \cdots \times (\# A_N)
$$
```

That is, number of possible tuples $=$ product of the number of
possibilities for each element

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Number of binary sequences of length $10$ is
$$
\# [\{0, 1\} \times \cdots \times \{0, 1\}]
= 2 \times \cdots \times 2 = 2^{10}
$$
```

**Infinite Cartesian Products**
%

If $\{A_n\}$ is a collection of sets, one
for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then
%
$$
A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots 
:= \{ (a_1, a_2, \ldots) : a_n \in A_n \text{ for each } n \in \mathbb{N} \}
$$
%
Sometimes denoted $\times_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$
%
If $A_n = A$ for all $n$, then $\times_{n=1}^{\infty} A$ also written as $A^{\mathbb{N}}$

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

The set of all binary sequences $\{0, 1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$
```



## Functions

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A ***function*** $f \colon A \rightarrow B$ from set $A$ to set $B$ is a rule that
associates to each element of $A$ a uniquely determined element of $B$
```

- $f \colon A \to B$ means that $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$


```{figure} _static/plots/function.png
:name: function
```

$A$ is called the ***domain*** of $f$ and $B$ is called the ***codomain***


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$f$ defined by 
%
$$
f(x) = \exp(-x^2)
$$ 
is a function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$

Sometimes we write the whole thing like this
%
$$
f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \\
x \mapsto \exp(-x^2), \text{ or}\\
f \colon \mathbb{R} \ni x \mapsto \exp(-x^2) \in \mathbb{R} 
$$

```

```{figure} _static/plots/allfunctions.png
:name: function_non_function

```

````{admonition} Example: not a function
:class: tip

```{figure} _static/plots/xy_non_func.png
:name: xy_non_func
```
````

For each $a \in A$, $f(a) \in B$ is called the ***image of $a$*** under $f$

```{figure} _static/plots/xy_func.png
:name: xy_func
```

If $f(a) = b$ then $a$ is called a ***preimage of $b$*** under $f$

```{figure} _static/plots/preimage.png
:name: preimage
```

A point in $B$ can have one, many or zero preimages

```{figure} _static/plots/preimage2.png
:name: preimage2
```

The codomain of a function is not uniquely pinned down

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Consider the mapping defined by 
$$f(x) = \exp(-x^2)$$ 

Both of these statements are valid:

- $f$ a function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$
- $f$ a function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $(0, \infty)$

```

The smallest possible codomain is called the ***range*** of $f \colon A \to B$:

$$
\mathrm{rng}(f) := \{ b \in B : f(a) = b \text{ for some } a \in A \} 
$$

```{figure} _static/plots/range.png
:name: range
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Let $f \colon [-1, 1] \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by
$$
f(x) =  0.6 \cos(4 x) + 1.4
$$
Then $\mathrm{rng}(f) = [0.8, 2.0]$

```

```{figure} _static/plots/range2.png
:name: range2
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

If $ f \colon [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by
$$
f(x) = 2x
$$
then $\mathrm{rng}(f) = [0, 2]$
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

If $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by 
$$
f(x) = \exp(x) 
$$
then $\mathrm{rng}(f) = (0, \infty)$
```


The ***composition*** of $f \colon A \to B$ and $g \colon B \to C$ is the
function $g \circ f$ from $A$ to $C$ defined by 
%
$$
(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) \quad (a \in A)
$$

```{figure} _static/plots/composition.png
:name: composition
```

## Onto Functions

A function $f \colon A \to B$ is called ***onto*** if every element of $B$
is the image under $f$ of at least one point in $A$.  


Equivalently, $\mathrm{rng}(f) = B$

```{figure} _static/plots/function1.png
:name: function1
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

$f \colon A \to B$ is onto if and only if each element of $B$
has at least one preimage under $f$

```

```{figure} _static/plots/bijection3.png
:name: bijection3

Onto
```

```{figure} _static/plots/function3.png
:name: function3
:scale: 50%

Not *onto*!
```

```{figure} _static/plots/bijection2.png
:name: bijection22
:scale: 50%

Not *onto*!
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

The function $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by
%
$$
f(x) = ax^3 + b x^2 + cx + d
$$
%
is onto whenever $a \ne 0$
```

To see this pick any $y \in \mathbb{R}$

We claim $\exists \; x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = y$

Equivalent:
%
$$
\exists \; x \in \mathbb{R} \; \mathrm{s.t.} \;
ax^3 + b x^2 + cx + d - y = 0
$$

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

 Every cubic equation with $a \ne 0$ has at least one real root
```

```{figure} _static/plots/cubic.png
:name: cubic

Cubic functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ are always onto
```


## One-to-One Functions

A function $f \colon A \to B$ is called ***one-to-one*** if distinct
elements of $A$ are always mapped into distinct elements of $B$.

That is, $f$ is one-to-one if

$$
a \in A, \; a' \in A  \text{ and } a \ne a' 
\implies f(a) \ne f(a')
$$

Equivalently,

$$
f(a) = f(a') \implies a = a'
$$


```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

$f \colon A \to B$ is one-to-one if and only if each element of $B$
has at most one preimage under $f$
```

```{figure} _static/plots/bijection2.png

:scale: 50%

Not one-to-one
```

## Bijections

A function that is 
%
1. one-to-one and 
9. onto 
%
is called a ***bijection*** or ***one-to-one correspondence***

```{figure} _static/plots/bijection3.png
:name: bijection3a
:scale: 50%
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

$f \colon A \to B$ is a bijection if and only if each $b \in B$ has
```
one and only one preimage in $A$

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$x \mapsto 2x$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$
```
```{figure} _static/plots/x_to_2x.png
:name: x_to_2x
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$k \mapsto -k$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$
```
```{figure} _static/plots/k_to_minus_k.png
:name: k_to_minus_k
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$x \mapsto x^2$ is ***not*** a bijection from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}
$
```

```{figure} _static/plots/x_squared.png
:name: x_squared
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $f \colon A \to B$ a bijection, then there exists a unique
function $\phi \colon B \to A$ such that 
%
$$
\phi(f(a)) = a, \quad \forall \; a \in A
$$

That function $\phi$ is called the ***inverse*** of $f$ and written $f^{-1}$
```


```{figure} _static/plots/bijec.png

:class: tip

Let 
%
- $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to (0, \infty)$ be defined by $f(x) = \exp(x) :=
e^x$
- $\phi \colon (0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $\phi(x) = \log(x)$


Then $\phi = f^{-1}$ because, for any $a \in \mathbb{R}$,
%
$$
\phi(f(a)) = \log(\exp(a)) = a
$$
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

 If $f \colon A \to B$ is one-to-one, then $f \colon A \to \mathrm{rng}(f)$ is a bijection

```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

 Let $f \colon A \to B$ and $g \colon B \to C$ be bijections
%
1. $f^{-1}$ is a bijection and its inverse is $f$
- $f^{-1}(f(a)) = a$ for all $a \in A$
- $f(f^{-1}(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$
- $g \circ f$ is a bijection from $A$ to $C$ and $(g \circ f)^{-1}
= f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}$
\end{enumerate}
%
```

## Cardinality

If a bijection exists between sets $A$ and $B$ they are said to have the ***same cardinality***, and we write $|A| = |B|$

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $|A| = |B|$ and $A$ and $B$ are finite then $A$ and $B$ have the same number of elements (same cardinality).
```

**Exercise:** Convince yourself this is true

Hence "same cardinality" is analogous to "same size" 

- But cardinality applies to infinite sets as well!

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $|A| = |B|$ and $|B| = |C|$ then $|A| = |C|$
```

**Proof:** 

- Since $|A| = |B|$, there exists a bijection $f \colon A \to B$
- Since $|B| = |C|$, there exists a bijection $g \colon B \to C$

Let $h := g \circ f$

Then $h$ is a bijection from $A$ to $C$

Hence $|A| = |C|$


A nonempty set $A$ is called ***finite*** if 
$$
|A| = |\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}|
\quad \text{ for some } \quad
n \in \mathbb{N}
$$

Otherwise called ***infinite***

Sets that either

1. are finite, or
9. have the same cardinality as $\mathbb{N}$ 

are called ***countable***, denoted $|A| = \aleph_0$


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$-\mathbb{N} := \{\ldots, -4, -3, -2, -1\}$ is countable 
```
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
-1 & \leftrightarrow & 1 \\
-2 & \leftrightarrow & 2 \\
-3 & \leftrightarrow & 3 \\
& \vdots &  \\
-n & \leftrightarrow & n \\
& \vdots &  
\end{array}
$$

Formally: $f(k) = -k$ is a bijection from $-\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$E := \{2, 4, \ldots\}$ is countable 
```
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
2 & \leftrightarrow & 1 \\
4 & \leftrightarrow & 2 \\
6 & \leftrightarrow & 3 \\
& \vdots &  \\
2n & \leftrightarrow & n \\
& \vdots &  
\end{array}
$$

Formally: $f(k) = k/2$ is a bijection from $E$ to $\mathbb{N}$


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$\{100, 200, 300, \ldots\}$ is countable 
```
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
100 & \leftrightarrow & 1 \\
200 & \leftrightarrow & 2 \\
300 & \leftrightarrow & 3 \\
& \vdots &  \\
100n & \leftrightarrow & n \\
& \vdots &  
\end{array}
$$

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Nonempty subsets of countable sets are countable
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Finite unions of countable sets are countable
```

Sketch of proof, for 

- $A$ and $B$ countable $\implies A \cup B$ countable
- $A$ and $B$ are disjoint and infinite

By assumption, can write $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots\}$ and $B = \{b_1, b_2,
\ldots\}$

Now count it like so:
%
$$
\begin{matrix}
a_1 &      & a_2 &      & a_3 &      & a_4 & \cdots\\
\downarrow & \nearrow & \downarrow & \nearrow & \downarrow & \nearrow & \downarrow & \nearrow \\
b_1 &      & b_2 &      & b_3 &      & b_4 & \cdots  
\end{matrix}
$$

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Finite Cartesian products of countable sets is countable
```

Sketch of proof, for 

- $A$ and $B$ countable $\implies A \times B$ countable
- $A$ and $B$ are disjoint and infinite

Now count like so:
%
$$
\begin{matrix}
(a_{1},b_{1})&\to &(a_{1},b_{2})&       & (a_{1},b_{3})&\to\cdots\\
&\swarrow&             &\nearrow   &              & \\
(a_{2},b_{1})&    &(a_{2},b_{2})&       &\cdots        & \\
\downarrow   &\nearrow&             &       &              & \\
(a_{3},b_{1})&    &\vdots       &       &              & \\
\vdots       &    &             &       &              & 
\end{matrix}
$$
%


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} = \{ (p,q) : p \in \mathbb{Z}, q \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ is countable 
```
```{figure} _static/plots/lattice.png
:name: lattice
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

$\mathbb{Q}$ is countable
```

**Proof:** By definition 
%
$$
\mathbb{Q}:= 
\left\{ \, 
\text{all } \frac{p}{q}
\text{ where } p \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and }  q \in \mathbb{N} \,
\right\}
$$

Consider the function $\phi$ defined by $\phi(p/q) = (p, q)$

- A one-to-one function from $\mathbb{Q}$ to $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}$
- A bijection from $\mathbb{Q}$ to $\mathrm{rng}(\phi)$

Since $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countable, so is $\mathrm{rng}(\phi) \subset \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}$

Hence $\mathbb{Q}$ is also countable



```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

An example of an ***uncountable*** set is all binary sequences
$$
\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}} := \big\{ (b_1,b_2,\ldots) :  \, b_n \in \{0,1\ \} \text{
for each } n \big\}
$$
```

**Sketch of proof:** If this set were countable then it could be listed as follows:
%
$$
\begin{matrix}
1      & \leftrightarrow & {\bf a_1}, \; a_2, \; a_3, \; a_4, \ldots \\
2      & \leftrightarrow & b_1, \;{\bf b_2}, \; b_3, \; b_4, \ldots \\
3      & \leftrightarrow & c_1, \; c_2, \;{\bf c_3}, \; c_4, \ldots \\
4      & \leftrightarrow & d_1, \; d_2, \; d_3, \;{\bf d_4}, \ldots \\
\vdots &                 & \vdots
\end{matrix}
$$
%

Such a list is never complete: Cantor's diagonalization argument

Cardinality of  $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ called the ***power of the continuum***

Other sets with the power of the continuum

- $\mathbb{R}$
- $(a, b)$ for any $a < b$
- $[a, b]$ for any $a < b$
- $\mathbb{R}^N$ for any finite $N \in \mathbb{N}$


```{admonition} Continuum hypothesis
:class: important

Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is either 
countable or has the power of the continuum
```
- [Not a homework exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis)!


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$\mathbb{R}$ and $(-1, 1)$ have the same cardinality because $x \mapsto 2\arctan(x)/\pi$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{R}$ to $(-1, 1)$
