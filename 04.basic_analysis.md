# üìñ Sequences, limits and continuity 

<small>‚è± <span class="eta"></span> | <span class="words"></span> words</small>

Review of the basics of **real analysis** (mathematical analysis studies sequences, limit, continuity, differentiation, integration, etc.)

```{admonition} Setting the goals

This lecture is on general theory of maxima and minima, and their **existence**.

- we have to cover a lot of ground, mostly somewhat familiar
- will work in $\mathbb{R}^N$, the multidimensional space of *real* numbers ü§ì

Plan:
1. Measuring distances in $\mathbb{R}^N$ $\rightarrow$ convergence
2. Bounded sets sets $\rightarrow$ compact sets, existence of limits
3. Sequences $\rightarrow$ convergence
4. Limits and convergences $\rightarrow$ closedness
5. Open and closed sets $\rightarrow$ compacts
6. Limits for functions $\rightarrow$ continuity
7. Continuity of functions 
8. **Weierstrass extreme value theorem** (continuous functions on compacts)

```


```{note}
:class: warning
Many textbooks use **bold** notation for vectors, but we do not. Typically it is explicitly stated that $x \in \mathbb{R}^N$.
```

## Norm and distance

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution
:name: norm

The (Euclidean) **norm** of $x \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is defined as
:::{math}
\| x \| = \left( \sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 \right)^{1/2}
:::

```

Interpretation:
%
- $\| x \|$ represents the _length_ of $x$
- $\| x - y \|$ represents distance between $x$ and $y$


```{figure} _static/plots/vec.png
:name: vec
:width: 40%

Length of red line $= \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2} =: \|x\|$
```

$\| x - y \|$ represents distance between $x$ and $y$

```{figure} _static/plots/vec_minus.png
:name: vec_minus
:width: 40%

Length of red line $= \|x - y\|$
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

For any $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^N$, the following statements are true:

- $\| x \| \geq 0$ and $\| x \| = 0$ if and only if
$x = 0$
- $\| \alpha x \| = |\alpha| \| x \|$

**Triangle inequality**
- $\| x + y \| \leq  \| x \| + \| y \|$

% **Cauchy‚ÄìBunyakovsky‚ÄìSchwarz inequality**
% - $| x' y | \leq  \| x \| \| y \|$

```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

For example, let's show that $\| x \| = 0 \iff x = 0$

First let's assume that $\| x \| = 0$ and show $x = 0$

Since $\| x \| = 0$ we have $\| x \|^2 = 0$ and hence
$\sum_{n=1}^N x^2_n = 0$

That is $x_n = 0$ for all $n$, or, equivalently, $x = 0$

Next let's assume that $x = 0$ and show $\| x \| = 0$ 

This is immediate from the definition of the norm

````

In fact, any function can be used as a norm, provided that the listed properties are satisfied

````{admonition} Example
:class: tip

More general distance function in $\mathbb{R}$.

```{figure} _static/img/metric.png
   :width: 80%

Circle drawn with different norms
```
````

Naturally, in $\mathbb{R}$ Euclidean norm simplifies to
:::{math}
\| x \| = \sqrt{x^2} = |x|

def subplots():

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()

    # Set the axes through the origin
    for spine in ['left', 'bottom']:
        ax.spines[spine].set_position('zero')
    for spine in ['right', 'top']:
        ax.spines[spine].set_color('none')
    
    ax.grid()
    return fig, ax

fig, ax = subplots()

ax.set_ylim(-3, 3)
ax.set_yticks((-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3))
x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
ax.plot(x, np.abs(x), 'g-', lw=2, alpha=0.7, label=r'$f(x) = |x|$')
ax.plot(x, x, 'k--', lw=2, alpha=0.7, label=r'$f(x) = x$')
ax.legend(loc='lower right')

plt.show()
```

Therefore we can think of norm as a generalization of the absolute value to $\mathbb{R}$


## Bounded sets

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution
:name: bounded-sets

A set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ called **bounded** if 
:::{math}
\exists \, M \in \mathbb{R} 
\; \mathrm{such\;that} \;
\|x\| \leq M, \quad \forall \; x \in A
:::
```

```{figure} _static/plots/bounded-set.png
:name: bounded
:width: 40%

Bounded set in $\mathbb{R}^2$
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Every finite subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded

Indeed, set $M := \max \{  |a| : a \in A \}$.  Then $A$ is bounded by definition
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

% $\mathbb{N}$ is unbounded. For any $M \in \mathbb{R}$ there is an $n$ that exceeds it.
The set $\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2\colon xy \leqslant 1 \}$ is unbounded

**Proof:**

For any $M \in \mathbb{R}$ consider the point whit coordinates $x=1/M$ and $y=M$.  This point belongs to the set because it satisfies $xy=1$, yet 
:::{math}
\| (x,y) \| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{M^2} + M^2} > \sqrt{ M^2} = M
:::
Therefore, for any candidate bound $M$ we can find points in the set that are further away from the origin than $M$.
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$(a, b)$ is bounded for any $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$

**Proof:**

Let $M := \max\{ |a|, |b| \}$.
We have to show that each $x \in (a, b)$ satisfies $|x| \leq M$
:::{math}
x \in (a, b) \iff a < x < b
:::
Cases:
1. $0 \le a \le b \implies x > 0, x = |x| < |b| = b = \max\{|a|,|b|\}$
2. $a \le b \le 0 \implies a < x < 0, |x|= -x < -a = |a| = \max\{|a|,|b|\}$
3. $a \le 0 \le b \implies$
:::{math}
\begin{cases}
|x|<|b|, x \ge 0\\
|x|<|a|, x < 0
\end{cases}
\implies |x|< \max\{|a|,|b|\} \text{ from 1. and 2.}
$$

```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $A$ and $B$ are bounded sets then so is $A \cup B$
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Let $A$ and $B$ be bounded sets and let $C := A \cup B$

By definition, $\exists \, M_A$ and $M_B$ with
:::{math}
\|a\| \leq M_A, \text{ all } a \in A, 
\quad \quad
\|b\| \leq M_B, \text{ all } b \in B
:::
Let $M_C := \max\{M_A , M_B\}$ and fix any $x \in C$
:::{math}
x \in C
\implies x \in A \text{ or } x \in B
:::
:::{math}
\text{therefore } \|x\| \leq M_A \quad \text{or} \quad \|x\| \leq M_B
:::
:::{math}
\text{therefore } \|x\| \leq M_C

## $\epsilon$-balls



```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

For $\epsilon > 0$, the $\epsilon$-ball $B_{\epsilon}(a)$ around
$a \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is all $x \in \mathbb{R}^N$ such that $\|a - x\|
< \epsilon$

```

```{figure} _static/plots/eps_ball2D.png
:name: eps_ball2D
:width: 40%
```

Correspondingly, in one dimension $\mathbb{R}$
:::{math}
B_\epsilon(a)
= \{ x \in \mathbb{R} :  a - \epsilon < x < a + \epsilon \}
:::
```{figure} _static/plots/eps_ball1D.png
:name: eps_ball1D
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $x$ is in every $\epsilon$-ball around $a$ then $x=a$
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Suppose to the contrary that 
%
- $x$ is in every $\epsilon$-ball around $a$ and yet $x \ne a$

Since $x$ is not $a$ we must have $\|x-a\| > 0$  

Set $\epsilon := \|x-a\|$  

Since $\epsilon > 0$, we have $x \in B_{\epsilon}(a)$

This means that $\|x-a\| < \epsilon$

That is, $\|x - a\| < \|x - a\|$ 

Contradiction!
````

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $a \ne b$, then $\exists \; \epsilon > 0$ such that $B_{\epsilon}(a)$ and $B_{\epsilon}(b)$ are disjoint.
```

```{figure} _static/plots/disjnt_balls0.png
:name: disjnt_balls1
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}^N$ with $a \ne b$

If we set $\epsilon := \|a-b\|/2$, then $B_{\epsilon}(a)$ and
$B_\epsilon(b)$ are disjoint

To see this, suppose to the contrary that $\exists \, x \in B_{\epsilon}(a) \cap B_\epsilon(B)$ 

Then $ \|x - a\| < \|a -b\|/2$ and $\|x - b\| < \|a -b\|/2$

But then
:::{math}
\|a - b\| \leq \|a - x\| + \|x - b\| < \|a -b\|/2 + \|a -b\|/2 = \|a-b\|
:::
Contradiction!
````


(ref-sequences)=
## Sequences

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A **sequence** $\{x_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{R}^N$

```

To each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we associate one $x_n \in \mathbb{R}^N$

Typically written as $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ or $\{x_n\}$ or $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots\}$

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

In $\mathbb{R}$
- $\{x_n\} = \{2, 4, 6, \ldots \}$
- $\{x_n\} = \{1, 1/2, 1/4, \ldots \}$
- $\{x_n\} = \{1, -1, 1, -1, \ldots \}$
- $\{x_n\} = \{0, 0, 0, \ldots \}$

In $\mathbb{R}^N$
- $\{x_n\} = \big\{(2,..,2), (4,..,4), (6,..,6), \ldots \big\}$
- $\{x_n\} = \big\{(1, 1/2), (1/2,1/4), (1/4,1/8), \ldots \big\}$

```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Sequence $\{x_n\}$ is called **bounded** if $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots\}$ is a bounded set.
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

:::{math}
x_n = 1/n \quad x_n = (-1)^n \quad x_n = 2n
:::
:::{math}
\text{(bounded)} \quad \text{(bounded)} \quad \text{(unbounded)}
:::

```




## Convergence and limit

### $\mathbb{R}^1$

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence

Suppose, for any $\epsilon > 0$, we can find an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
:::{math}
x_n \in B_\epsilon(a) \text{ for all } n \geq N
:::
alternatively for $\mathbb{R}$
:::{math}
| x_n -a | <\epsilon \text{ for all } n \geq N
:::
Then $\{x_n\}$ is said to **converge** to $a$

Convergence to $a$ in symbols,
:::{math}
\forall \, \epsilon > 0, \;
\exists \, N \in \mathbb{N} \; 
\text{ such that } n \geq N \implies x_n \in B_{\epsilon}(a)
:::
The sequence $\{x_n\}$ is eventually in this $\epsilon$-ball around $a$

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

The point $a$ is called the **limit** of the sequence, denoted
:::{math}
x_n \to a \text{ as } n \to \infty 
\quad \text{ or } \quad
\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = a,
:::
if 
:::{math}
\forall \, \epsilon > 0, \;
\exists \, N \in \mathbb{N} \; 
\text{ such that } n \geq N \implies |x_n - a|< \epsilon
:::
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$\{x_n\}$ defined by $x_n = 1 + 1/n$ converges to $1$:
:::{math}
x_n \to 1 \; \mathrm{as} \; n \to \infty
\quad\text{or}\quad
\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = 1
:::

To prove this must show that $\forall \, \epsilon > 0$, there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
:::{math}
n \geq N
\implies
|x_n - 1| < \epsilon
:::

To show this formally we need to come up with an  "algorithm"

1. You give me any $\epsilon > 0$
9. I respond with an $N$ such that equation above holds

In general, as $\epsilon$ shrinks, $N$ will have to grow

**Proof:**

Here's how to do this for the case $1 + 1/n$ converges to $1$

First pick an arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$  

Now we have to come up with an $N$ such that 
:::{math}
n \geq N
\implies
|1 + 1/n - 1| < \epsilon
:::

Let $N$ be the first integer greater than $ 1/\epsilon$ 

Then 
:::{math}
n \geq N 
\implies n > 1/\epsilon 
\implies 1/n < \epsilon 
\implies |1 + 1/n - 1| < \epsilon 
:::
Remark: Any $N' > N$ would also work
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

The sequence $x_n = 2^{-n}$ converges to $0$ as $n \to \infty$

**Proof:**

Must show that, $\forall \, \epsilon > 0$, $\exists \, N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
:::{math}
n \geq N
\implies
|2^{-n} - 0| < \epsilon
:::

So pick any $\epsilon > 0$, and observe that
:::{math}
|2^{-n} - 0| < \epsilon
\; \iff \;
2^{-n}  < \epsilon
\; \iff \;
n > - \frac{\ln \epsilon}{\ln 2}
:::
Hence we take $N$ to be the first integer greater than $- \ln \epsilon /
\ln 2$

Then 
:::{math}
n \geq N 
\implies n > -\frac{\ln \epsilon}{\ln 2}
\implies |2^{-n} - 0| < \epsilon
:::
````

What if we want to show that $x_n \to a$ fails?

To show convergence fails we need to show the **negation**
of
:::{math}
\forall \,\; \epsilon > 0, \;\; 
\exists \,\; N \in \mathbb{N} \;\mathrm{such\;that}\; n \geq N
\implies x_n \in B_{\epsilon}(a)
:::

In words, there is an $\epsilon > 0$ where we can't find any such $N$

That is, for any choice of $N$ there will be $n>N$ such that $x_n$ jumps to the outside $B_{\epsilon}(a)$

In other words, there exists a $B_\epsilon(a)$ such that $x_n \notin B_\epsilon(a)$ again and again as $n \to \infty$.

This is the kind of picture we're thinking of

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

The sequence $x_n = (-1)^n$ does **not** converge to any $a \in \mathbb{R}$

**Proof:**

This is what we want to show
:::{math}
\exists \,\;  \epsilon > 0 \;\text{ such that } x_n \notin B_{\epsilon}(a) \text{ infinitely many times as } n \to \infty
:::
Since it's a "there exists", we need to come up with such an $\epsilon$

Let's try $\epsilon = 0.5$, so that 
:::{math}
B_\epsilon(a) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : |x - a| < 0.5 \} = (a-0.5, a+0.5 )
:::
We have:
- If $n$ is odd then $x_n = -1$ when $n > N$ for _any_ $N$.
- If $n$ is even then $x_n = 1$ when $n > N$ for _any_ $N$.

Therefore even if $a=1$ or $a=-1$, $\{x_n\}$ not in $B_\epsilon(a)$ infinitely many times as $n \to \infty$. It holds for all other values of $a \in \mathbb{R}$.
```


### $\mathbb{R}^N$


```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Sequence $\{x_n\}$ is said to **converge** to $a \in \mathbb{R}^N$ if
:::{math}
\forall \epsilon > 0, \;
\exists \, N \in \mathbb{N} \; 
\text{ such that } \; n \geq N \implies x_n \in B_{\epsilon}(a)
:::
```

We can say
> $\{x_n\}$ is eventually in any $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $a$

In this case $a$ is called the **limit** of the sequence, and as in one-dimensional case, we write
:::{math}
x_n \to a \; \text{ as } \; n \to \infty
\quad \text{or} \quad
\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = a

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

The sketch of the proof:
- $\Rightarrow$ (necessity): verify that the definition of convergence in $\mathbb{R}$ corresponds to the convergence in each dimension by definition where $\epsilon$-neighborhoods are projection of the $B_\epsilon(a)$
- $\Leftarrow$ (sufficiency): verify that convergence in $\mathbb{R}$ by definition follows from the definitions to the convergence in each dimension when the required $B_\epsilon(a)$ ball is constructed to contain the hypercube of the $\epsilon$-neighborhoods of each dimension.

### Cauchy sequences

Informal definition: Cauchy sequences are those where $|x_n - x_{n+1}|$ gets smaller and smaller

Sequences generated by iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations often have this property

A sequence $\{x_n\}$ is called **Cauchy** if
:::{math}
\forall \; \epsilon > 0, \;\; \exists \; N \in \mathbb{N} 
\; \mathrm{such\;that}\;  \forall n, m \geqslant N \implies \| x_n - x_m \| < \epsilon

\; \mathrm{such\;that}\;  \forall j \geqslant N \implies \| x_n - x_{n+j} \| < \epsilon
:::
```

Cauchy sequences allow to establish convergence without finding the limit itself!

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Every convergent sequence is Cauchy, and every Cauchy sequence is convergent.
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Proof of $\Rightarrow$: 

Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence converging to some $a \in \mathbb{R}$

Fix $\epsilon > 0$

We can choose $N$ s.t. 
:::{math}
n \geq N \;\; \implies \;\; |x_n - a | < \frac{\epsilon}{2} 
:::

For this $N$ we have $n \geq N$ and $j \geq 1$ implies
:::{math}
|x_n - x_{n+j}|
\leq |x_n - a| + |x_{n+j} - a|
< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon
:::

Proof of $\Leftarrow$:

Follows from the density property of $\mathbb{R}$

````


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$\{x_n\}$ defined by $x_n = \alpha^n$ where $\alpha \in
(0, 1)$ is Cauchy

**Proof:**

For any $n , j$ we have
:::{math}
|x_n - x_{n+j}|
= |\alpha^n - \alpha^{n+j}| 
= \alpha^n |1 - \alpha^j|  \leq \alpha^n
:::

Fix $\epsilon > 0$

We can show that $n > \log(\epsilon) / \log(\alpha) \implies \alpha^n < \epsilon$

Hence any integer $N > \log(\epsilon) / \log(\alpha)$ the sequence is Cauchy by definition.

### Subsequences


```{admonition} Definition

A sequence $\{x_{n_k} \}$ is called a **subsequence** of $\{x_n\}$ if 
%
1. $\{x_{n_k} \}$ is a subset of $\{x_n\}$
9. $\{n_k\}$ is sequence of strictly increasing natural numbers

:::
In this case
:::{math}
\{n_k\} = \{n_1, n_2, n_3, \ldots\} = \{2, 4, 6, \ldots\}

$\{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{5},\ldots\}$ is a

$\{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3},\ldots\}$ is a
subsequence of $\{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots\}$

$\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2},\ldots\}$ is **not** a
subsequence of $\{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots\}$

## Open and closed sets


```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Let $G \subset \mathbb{R}^N$.
We call $x \in G$ **interior** to $G$ if 
$\exists \; \epsilon > 0$ with $B_\epsilon(x) \subset G$

```

```{figure} _static/plots/interior.png
:name: interior
:width: 60%

Loosely speaking, interior means "not on the boundary"
```

````{admonition} Example
:class: tip

```{image} _static/img/peeled_tomato.png

:align: center
```

````

````{admonition} Example
:class: tip

If $G = (a, b)$ for some $a < b$, then any $x \in (a, b)$ is interior 

```{figure} _static/plots/x_interior.png
:name: x_interior
:width: 60%
```

**Proof:**

Fix any $a < b$ and any $x \in (a, b)$

Let $\epsilon := \min\{x - a, b - x\}$

If $y \in B_\epsilon(x)$ then $y < b$ because 
:::{math}

**Exercise:** Show $y \in B_\epsilon(x) \implies y > a$

There exists a $y \in B_\epsilon(1)$ such that $y \notin [-1, 1]$

For example, consider the point $y := 1 + \epsilon/2$

**Exercise:** Check this point: lies in $B_\epsilon(1)$ but not in $[-1, 1]$

````

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution
:name: open-sets

A set $G\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is called **open** if all of its points are interior 

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Open sets:
- any *open* interval $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$, since we showed all points are interior
- any *open* ball $B_\epsilon(a) = x \in \mathbb{R}^N : \|x - a \| < \epsilon$
- $\mathbb{R}^N$ itself satisfies the defintion of open set

Sets that are not open
- $(a,b]$ because $b$ is not interior 
- $[a,b)$ because $a$ is not interior 
```

### Closed Sets

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution
:name: closed-sets

A set $F \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is called **closed** if every convergent sequence in $F$ converges to a point in $F$

Rephrased: If $\{x_n\} \subset F$ and $x_n \to x$ for some
$x \in \mathbb{R}^N$, then $x \in F$

```


```{admonition} Example

All of $\mathbb{R}^N$ is closed $\Leftarrow$ every sequence converging to a point in $\mathbb{R}^N$ converges to a point in $\mathbb{R}^N$!
```

````{admonition} Example
:class: tip

**Proof:**

True because
%
1. $x_n := 1-1/n$ is a sequence in $(-1, 1)$ converging to $1$,
9. and yet $1 \notin (-1, 1)$

````

````{admonition} Example
:class: tip

If $F = [a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ then $F$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}$

**Proof:**

Take any sequence $\{x_n\}$ such that
%
- $x_n \in F$ for all $n$
- $x_n \to x$ for some $x \in \mathbb{R}$

We claim that $x \in F$

Recall that (weak) inequalities are preserved under limits:

- $x_n \leq b$ for all $n$ and $x_n \to x$, so $x \leq b$
- $x_n \geq a$ for all $n$ and $x_n \to x$, so $x \geq a$
%
therefore $x \in [a, b] =: F$

### Properties of Open and Closed Sets

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

$G \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is open $\iff \; G^c$ is closed
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

$\implies$ 

First prove necessity

Pick any $G$ and let $F := G^c$

Suppose to the contrary that $G$ is open but $F$ is not closed, so 
%
$\exists$ a sequence $\{x_n\} \subset F$ with limit $x \notin F$ 

Then $x \in G$, and since $G$ open, $\exists \, \epsilon > 0$ such
that $B_\epsilon(x) \subset G$

Since $x_n \to x$ we can choose an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $x_N \in
B_\epsilon(x)$

This contradicts $x_n \in F$ for all $n$

$\Longleftarrow$ 

Next prove sufficiency

Pick any closed $F$ and let $G := F^c$, need to prove that $G$ is open

Suppose to the contrary that $G$ is not open

Then exists some non-interior $x \in G$, that is no $\epsilon$-ball around $x$ lies entirely in $G$

Then it is possible to find a sequence $\{x_n\}$ which converges to $x \in G$, but every element of which lies in the $B_{1/n}(x) \cap F$

This contradicts the fact that $F$ is closed
````

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Any singleton $\{ x \} \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is closed

```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Let's prove this by showing that $\{x\}^c$ is open

Pick any $y \in \{x\}^c$

We claim that $y$ is interior to $\{x\}^c$

Since $y \in \{x\}^c$ it must be that $y \ne x$

Therefore, exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $B_\epsilon(y) \cap B_\epsilon(x) = \varnothing$

In particular, $x \notin B_\epsilon(y)$, and hence $B_\epsilon(y) \subset \{x\}^c$

Therefore $y$ is interior as claimed

Since $y$ was arbitrary it follows that $\{x\}^c$ is open and $\{x\}$ is closed

````


```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

1. Any finite union of open sets is open
9. Any finite intersection of closed sets is closed
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown


*Proof of first fact:*

Let $G := \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} G_\lambda$, where each $G_\lambda$ is
open

We claim that any given $x \in G$ is interior to $G$

Pick any $x \in G$

By definition, $x \in G_\lambda$ for some $\lambda$

Since $G_\lambda$ is open, $\exists \, \epsilon > 0$ such that $B_\epsilon(x)
\subset G_\lambda$

But $G_\lambda \subset G$, so $B_\epsilon(x) \subset G$ also holds

In other words, $x$ is interior to $G$ 

````

But be careful:  

- An **infinite** intersection of open sets is not necessarily open
- An **infinite** union of closed sets is not necessarily closed

For example, if $G_n := (-1/n, 1/n)$,  then $\cap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} G_n = \{0\} $  

% To see this, suppose that $x \in \cap_n G_n$
% 
% Then
% :::{math}
% -1/n < x < 1/n, \quad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
% :::
% Therefore $x = 0$, and hence $x \in \{0\}$  
% 
% On the other hand, if $x \in \{0\}$ then $x \in \cap_n G_n$

% ```{admonition} Fact

% Since $A$ is bounded, $\{x_n\}$ is bounded
% 
% Therefore it has a convergent subsequence

## Continuity of functions

Fundamental property of functions, required not only to establish existence of optima and optimizers, but also roots, fixed points, etc.

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution
:name: continuous-functions

Let $f \colon A \in \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$

$f$ is called **continuous at** $x \in A$ if
:::{math}
\forall \{x_n\} \in A \colon \lim_{n \to \inftry} x_n = x \in A
\quad \implies \quad
f(x_n) \to f(x) 
:::
```

Note that the definition requires that 

- $f(x_n)$ converges for each choice of $x_n \to x$,
- the limit is always the same, and that limit is $f(x)$

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

$f: A \to \mathbb{R}$ is called **continuous** if it is continuous at every $x \in
A$

Continuous function
```
```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Function $f(x) = \exp(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$

**Proof:**

Consider any sequence $\{x_n\}$ which converges to $0$

We want to show that for any $\epsilon>0$ there exists $N$ such that $n \geq N \implies |f(x_n) - f(0)| < \epsilon$.  We have
:::{math}
\begin{array}{l}
|f(x_n) - f(0)| = |\exp(x_n) - 1| < \epsilon \quad \iff \\
\exp(x_n) - 1 < \epsilon \; \text{ and } \; \exp(x_n) - 1 > -\epsilon  \quad \iff \\
x_n < \ln(1+\epsilon) \; \text{ and } \; x_n > \ln(1-\epsilon) \quad \Longleftarrow \\
| x_n - 0 | < \min \big(\ln(1+\epsilon),\ln(1-\epsilon) \big) = \ln(1-\epsilon)
\end{array}
:::
Because due to $x_n \to x$ for any $\epsilon' = \ln(1-\epsilon)$ there exists $N$ such that $n \geq N \implies |x_n - 0| < \epsilon'$, we have $f(x_n) \to f(x)$ by definition.  Thus, $f$ is continuous at $x=0$.

%Then exists $x_n \to x$ with $f(x_n) \nrightarrow f(x)$

%We can and do choose $\{x_n\}$ such that $x_n \ne x$ for all $n$

%Since $f(x_n) \nrightarrow f(x)$, exists $\epsilon > 0$ s.t. $|f(x_n) - f(x)| \geq \epsilon$

3. If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $x$ and real valued then so is
$f \circ g$, where

Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous at $x$

As a result, set of continuous functions is "closed" under elementary
arithmetic operations

- \frac{\cos^3(x)}{8!}

## Weierstrass boundedness theorem

Putting together all the above material to formulate a fundamental result which is essential for establishing the existence of maxima and minima of functions in the next section.

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A function $f$ is called **bounded** if its range is a bounded set.

```

(ref-boundedness)=
```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Consider a *continuous* function $f: X \subset \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$.

If $X$ is *compact*, then $f$ is bounded on $X$.
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Sketch of the proof:

- Suppose that range of $f$ denoted $f(X)$ is not a bounded set
- Then we can find a sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $X$ such $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists $f(x_n)$ such that $|f(n)|>n$.
- Sequence $\{x_n\}$ is bounded, so by Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem it has a convergent subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$, where $n_k$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ index by $k$, and thus $k \leqslant n_k$ for all $k$
- Denote by $L$ the limit of this subsequence, $L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \{x_{n_k}\}$
- $L \in X$ because $X$ is a compact and thus is a closed set
- By continuity of $f$ at $L$ we have that $f(x_{n_k}) \to f(L)$
- Then the sequence $\{f(x_{n_k})\}$ is bounded due to the properties of the limit (see above)
- This contradicts that by our construction $|f(x_n)| > n \geqslant k$ where $k$ can be arbitrary large
