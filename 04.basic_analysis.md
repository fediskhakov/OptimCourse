# üìñ Sequences, limits and continuity 

<small>‚è± <span class="eta"></span> | <span class="words"></span> words</small>

Review of the basics of **real analysis** (mathematical analysis studies sequences, limit, continuity, differentiation, integration, etc.)

```{admonition} Setting the goals

This lecture is on general theory of maxima and minima, and their **existence**.

- we have to cover a lot of ground, mostly somewhat familiar
- will work in $\mathbb{R}^N$, the multidimensional space of *real* numbers ü§ì

Plan:
1. Measuring distances in $\mathbb{R}^N$ $\rightarrow$ convergence
2. Bounded sets sets $\rightarrow$ compact sets, existence of limits
3. Sequences $\rightarrow$ convergence
4. Limits and convergences $\rightarrow$ closedness
5. Open and closed sets $\rightarrow$ compacts
6. Limits for functions $\rightarrow$ continuity
7. Continuity of functions 
8. **Weierstrass extreme value theorem** (continuous functions on compacts)

```


```{note}
:class: warning
Many textbooks use **bold** notation for vectors, but we do not unless essential for clarity.
```


## Norm and distance

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution
:name: norm

The (Euclidean) **norm** of ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is defined as
%
$$
\| {\bf x} \| 
:= \sqrt{{\bf x}' {\bf x} } 
= \left( \sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 \right)^{1/2}
$$
%

```

Interpretation:
%
- $\| {\bf x} \|$ represents the _length_ of ${\bf x}$
- $\| {\bf x} - {\bf y} \|$ represents distance between ${\bf x}$ and ${\bf y}$


```{figure} _static/plots/vec.png
:name: vec

Length of red line $= \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2} =: \|{\bf x}\|$
```

$\| {\bf x} - {\bf y} \|$ represents distance between ${\bf x}$ and ${\bf y}$

```{figure} _static/plots/vec_minus.png
:name: vec_minus

Length of red line $= \|{\bf x} - {\bf y}\|$
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

For any $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and any ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in \mathbb{R}^N$, the following statements are true:

- $\| {\bf x} \| \geq 0$ and $\| {\bf x} \| = 0$ if and only if
${\bf x} = {\bf 0}$
- $\| \alpha {\bf x} \| = |\alpha| \| {\bf x} \|$

**Triangle inequality**
- $\| {\bf x} + {\bf y} \| \leq  \| {\bf x} \| + \| {\bf y} \|$

**Cauchy‚ÄìBunyakovsky‚ÄìSchwarz inequality**
- $| {\bf x}' {\bf y} | \leq  \| {\bf x} \| \| {\bf y} \|$

```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

For example, let's show that $\| {\bf x} \| = 0 \iff {\bf x} = {\bf 0}$

First let's assume that $\| {\bf x} \| = 0$ and show ${\bf x} = {\bf 0}$

Since $\| {\bf x} \| = 0$ we have $\| {\bf x} \|^2 = 0$ and hence
$\sum_{n=1}^N x^2_n = 0$

That is $x_n = 0$ for all $n$, or, equivalently, ${\bf x} = {\bf 0}$

Next let's assume that ${\bf x} = {\bf 0}$ and show $\| {\bf x} \| = 0$ 

This is immediate from the definition of the norm

````

In fact, any function can be used as a norm, provided that the listed properties are satisfied

````{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Naturally, in $\mathbb{R}$ Euclidean norm simplifies to

\| x \| = \sqrt{x^2} = |x|

def subplots():
    "Custom subplots with axes throught the origin"
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()

    # Set the axes through the origin
    for spine in ['left', 'bottom']:
        ax.spines[spine].set_position('zero')
    for spine in ['right', 'top']:
        ax.spines[spine].set_color('none')
    
    ax.grid()
    return fig, ax

fig, ax = subplots()

ax.set_ylim(-3, 3)
ax.set_yticks((-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3))
x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
ax.plot(x, np.abs(x), 'g-', lw=2, alpha=0.7, label=r'$f(x) = |x|$')
ax.plot(x, x, 'k--', lw=2, alpha=0.7, label=r'$f(x) = x$')
ax.legend(loc='lower right')

plt.show()
```

Therefore we can think of norm as a generalization of the absolute value to $\mathbb{R}$


## Bounded sets

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution
:name: bounded-sets

A set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ called **bounded** if 
%
$$
\exists \, M \in \mathbb{R} 
\; \mathrm{such\;that} \;
\|{\bf x}\| \leq M, \quad \forall \; {\bf x} \in A
$$
%
```

```{figure} _static/plots/bounded.png
:name: bounded
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Every finite subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded

Indeed, set $M := \max \{  |a| : a \in A \}$.  Then $A$ is bounded by definition
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$\mathbb{N}$ is unbounded. For any $M \in \mathbb{R}$ there is an $n$ that exceeds it.

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$(a, b)$ is bounded for any $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$

**Proof:**

Let $M := \max\{ |a|, |b| \}$.
We have to show that each $x \in (a, b)$ satisfies $|x| \leq M$
%
$$
x \in (a, b) \iff a < x < b
$$
%
Cases:
1. $0 \le a \le b \implies x > 0, x = |x| < |b| = b = \max\{|a|,|b|\}$
2. $a \le b \le 0 \implies a < x < 0, |x|= -x < -a = |a| = \max\{|a|,|b|\}$
3. $a \le 0 \le b \implies$
%
$$
\begin{cases}
|x|<|b|, x \ge 0\\
|x|<|a|, x < 0
\end{cases}
\implies |x|< \max\{|a|,|b|\} \text{ from 1. and 2.}
$$

```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $A$ and $B$ are bounded sets then so is $A \cup B$
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Let $A$ and $B$ be bounded sets and let $C := A \cup B$

By definition, $\exists \, M_A$ and $M_B$ with
%
$$
\|a\| \leq M_A, \text{ all } a \in A, 
\quad \quad
\|b\| \leq M_B, \text{ all } b \in B
$$
%
Let $M_C := \max\{M_A , M_B\}$ and fix any $x \in C$
%
$$
x \in C
\implies x \in A \text{ or } x \in B
$$
%
$$
\text{therefore } \|x\| \leq M_A \quad \text{or} \quad \|x\| \leq M_B
$$
%
$$
\text{therefore } \|x\| \leq M_C

## $\epsilon$-balls



```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

For $\epsilon > 0$, the $\epsilon$-ball $B_{\epsilon}({\bf a})$ around
${\bf a} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is all ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ such that $\|{\bf a} - {\bf x}\|
< \epsilon$

```

```{figure} _static/plots/eps_ball2D.png
:name: eps_ball2D
:scale: 80%
```

Correspondingly, in one dimension $\mathbb{R}$
%
$$
B_\epsilon(a)
= \{ x \in \mathbb{R} :  a - \epsilon < x < a + \epsilon \}
$$
%
```{figure} _static/plots/eps_ball1D.png
:name: eps_ball1D
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $x$ is in every $\epsilon$-ball around $a$ then $x=a$
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Suppose to the contrary that 
%
- $x$ is in every $\epsilon$-ball around $a$ and yet $x \ne a$

Since $x$ is not $a$ we must have $\|x-a\| > 0$  

Set $\epsilon := \|x-a\|$  

Since $\epsilon > 0$, we have $x \in B_{\epsilon}(a)$

This means that $\|x-a\| < \epsilon$

That is, $\|x - a\| < \|x - a\|$ 

Contradiction!
````

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $a \ne b$, then $\exists \; \epsilon > 0$ such that $B_{\epsilon}(a)$ and $B_{\epsilon}(b)$ are disjoint.
```

```{figure} _static/plots/disjnt_balls0.png
:name: disjnt_balls1
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}^N$ with $a \ne b$

If we set $\epsilon := \|a-b\|/2$, then $B_{\epsilon}(a)$ and
$B_\epsilon(b)$ are disjoint

To see this, suppose to the contrary that $\exists \, x \in B_{\epsilon}(a) \cap B_\epsilon(B)$ 

Then $ \|x - a\| < \|a -b\|/2$ and $\|x - b\| < \|a -b\|/2$

But then
%
$$
\|a - b\| \leq \|a - x\| + \|x - b\| < \|a -b\|/2 + \|a -b\|/2 = \|a-b\|
$$
%
Contradiction!
````


(ref-sequences)=
## Sequences

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A **sequence** $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{R}^N$

```

To each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we associate one $x_n \in \mathbb{R}^N$

Typically written as $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ or $\{x_n\}$ or $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots\}$

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

In $\mathbb{R}$
- $\{x_n\} = \{2, 4, 6, \ldots \}$
- $\{x_n\} = \{1, 1/2, 1/4, \ldots \}$
- $\{x_n\} = \{1, -1, 1, -1, \ldots \}$
- $\{x_n\} = \{0, 0, 0, \ldots \}$

In $\mathbb{R}^N$
- $\{x_n\} = \big\{(2,..,2), (4,..,4), (6,..,6), \ldots \big\}$
- $\{x_n\} = \big\{(1, 1/2), (1/2,1/4), (1/4,1/8), \ldots \big\}$

```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Sequence $\{x_n\}$ is called **bounded** if $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots\}$ is a bounded set.
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

:::{math}
x_n = 1/n \quad x_n = (-1)^n \quad x_n = 2n

## Convergence and limit

### $\mathbb{R}^1$

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence

Suppose, for any $\epsilon > 0$, we can find an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
%
$$
x_n \in B_\epsilon(a) \text{ for all } n \geq N
$$
%
Then $\{x_n\}$ is said to **converge** to $a$

Convergence to $a$ in symbols,
%
$$
\forall \, \epsilon > 0, \;
\exists \, N \in \mathbb{N} \; 
\text{ such that } n \geq N \implies x_n \in B_{\epsilon}(a)
$$
%
The sequence $\{x_n\}$ is eventually in this $\epsilon$-ball around $a$

```{figure} _static/plots/convergent_seqs1.png

...and this one

%
```{figure} _static/plots/convergent_seqs2.png

...and this one

:scale: 50%
```
...and this one

%
```{figure} _static/plots/convergent_seqs4.png
:scale: 50%
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

The point $a$ is called the **limit** of the sequence, denoted
%
$$ 
x_n \to a \text{ as } n \to \infty 
\quad \text{ or } \quad
\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = a,
$$
%
if 
%
$$
\forall \, \epsilon > 0, \;
\exists \, N \in \mathbb{N} \; 
\text{ such that } n \geq N \implies |x_n - a|< \epsilon
$$
%
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$\{x_n\}$ defined by $x_n = 1 + 1/n$ converges to $1$:
%
$$
x_n \to 1 \; \mathrm{as} \; n \to \infty
$$
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = 1
$$
%
```

To prove this must show that $\forall \, \epsilon > 0$, there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
%
$$
n \geq N
\implies
|x_n - 1| < \epsilon
$$
%

To show this formally we need to come up with an  "algorithm"

1. You give me any $\epsilon > 0$
9. I respond with an $N$ such that equation above holds

In general, as $\epsilon$ shrinks, $N$ will have to grow

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Here's how to do this for the case $1 + 1/n$ converges to $1$

First pick an arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$  

Now we have to come up with an $N$ such that 
%
$$
n \geq N
\implies
|1 + 1/n - 1| < \epsilon
$$
%

Let $N$ be the first integer greater than $ 1/\epsilon$ 

Then 
%
$$
n \geq N 
\implies n > 1/\epsilon 
\implies 1/n < \epsilon 
\implies |1 + 1/n - 1| < \epsilon 
$$
%
Remark: Any $N' > N$ would also work
````

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

The sequence $x_n = 2^{-n}$ converges to $0$ as $n \to \infty$
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Must show that, $\forall \, \epsilon > 0$, $\exists \, N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
%
$$
n \geq N
\implies
|2^{-n} - 0| < \epsilon
$$
%

So pick any $\epsilon > 0$, and observe that
%
$$
|2^{-n} - 0| < \epsilon
\; \iff \;
2^{-n}  < \epsilon
\; \iff \;
n > - \frac{\ln \epsilon}{\ln 2}
$$
%
Hence we take $N$ to be the first integer greater than $- \ln \epsilon /
\ln 2$

Then 
%
$$
n \geq N 
\implies n > -\frac{\ln \epsilon}{\ln 2}
\implies |2^{-n} - 0| < \epsilon
$$
%
````

What if we want to show that $x_n \to a$ fails?

To show convergence fails we need to show the **negation**
of
%
$$
\forall \,\; \epsilon > 0, \;\; 
\exists \,\; N \in \mathbb{N} \;\mathrm{such\;that}\; n \geq N
\implies x_n \in B_{\epsilon}(a)
$$
%

Negation: there is an $\epsilon > 0$ where we can't find any such $N$

More specifically, $\exists \, \epsilon > 0$ such that, which ever $N \in
\mathbb{N}$ we look at, there's an $n \geq N$ with $x_n$ outside $B_{\epsilon}(a)$

One way to say this: there exists a $B_\epsilon(a)$ such that $x_n \notin B_\epsilon(a)$ again and again as $n \to \infty$.

This is the kind of picture we're thinking of

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

The sequence $x_n = (-1)^n$ does **not** converge to any $a \in \mathbb{R}$
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

This is what we want to show
%
$$
\exists \,\;  \epsilon > 0 \;\text{ such that } x_n \notin B_{\epsilon}(a) \text{ infinitely many times as } n \to \infty
$$
%
Since it's a "there exists", we need to come up with such an $\epsilon$

Let's try $\epsilon = 0.5$, so that 
%
$$
B_\epsilon(a) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : |x - a| < 0.5 \} = (a-0.5, a+0.5 )
$$
%
We have:
- If $n$ is odd then $x_n = -1$ when $n > N$ for _any_ $N$.
- If $n$ is even then $x_n = 1$ when $n > N$ for _any_ $N$.

Therefore even if $a=1$ or $a=-1$, $\{x_n\}$ not in $B_\epsilon(a)$ infinitely many times as $n \to \infty$. It holds for all other values of $a \in \mathbb{R}$.
````

### $\mathbb{R}^N$


```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Sequence $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ is said to **converge** to ${\bf a} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ if
%
$$
\forall \epsilon > 0, 
\;
\exists \, N \in \mathbb{N}
\; 
\text{ such that }  n \geq N \implies {\bf x}_n \in B_{\epsilon}({\bf a})
$$

```

We say: "$\{{\bf x}_n\}$ is eventually in any $\epsilon$-neighborhood of ${\bf a}$"

In this case ${\bf a}$ is called the **limit** of the sequence, and we write
%
$$ 
{\bf x}_n \to {\bf a} \; \text{ as } \; n \to \infty
\quad \text{or} \quad
\lim_{n \to \infty} {\bf x}_n = {\bf a}
$$

### Vector vs Componentwise Convergence

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

A sequence $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ converges to ${\bf a} \in \mathbb{R}^N$
if and only if each component sequence converges in $\mathbb{R}$

Analogous to the scalar case,

2. If ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$ and ${\bf y}_n \to {\bf y}$ then ${\bf x}_n +
{\bf y}_n \to {\bf x} +  {\bf y}$
3. If ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ then $\alpha {\bf x}_n 
\to \alpha {\bf x}$
4. If ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$ and ${\bf z} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ then ${\bf z}' {\bf x}_n 
\to {\bf z}' {\bf x}$
5. Each sequence in $\mathbb{R}^N$ has at most one limit
6. Every convergent sequence in $\mathbb{R}^N$ is bounded
7. Every convergent sequence in $\mathbb{R}^N$ is Cauchy
8. Every Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}^N$ is convergent
%        %        9. Every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}^N$ has a convergent subsequence

#### Operations with limits

Here are some basic tools for working with limits

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $x_n \to x$ and  $y_n \to y$, then 
%
1. $x_n + y_n \to x +  y$
2. $x_n y_n \to x y$
3. $x_n /y_n \to x / y$ when $y_n$ and $y$ are $\ne 0$
9. $x_n \leq y_n$ for all $n \implies x \leq y$
```

Let's check that $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$ implies $x_n + y_n \to x +  y$

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Fix $\epsilon > 0$

Need to find $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
%
$$
n \geq N 
\; \implies \;
|(x_n + y_n) - (x + y)| < \epsilon
$$

Note that 
%
- $|(x_n + y_n) - (x + y)| \leq |x_n - x| + |y_n - y|$ by triangle inequality
- $\exists N_x \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \geq N_x \implies |x_n - x| < \epsilon/2$ by definition of the limit
- $\exists N_y \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \geq N_y \implies |y_n - y| < \epsilon/2$ by definition of the limit as well
%

Take $N := \max\{N_x, N_y\}$

Combining the inequalities above concludes the proof.

````


Let's also check the claim that $x_n \to x$,  $y_n \to y$  and 
$x_n \leq y_n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ implies $x \leq y$

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Suppose instead that $x > y$

Take disjoint $\epsilon$-balls $B_\epsilon(x)$ and $B_\epsilon(y)$ around
these points

```{figure} _static/plots/disjnt_balls0.png
:name: disjnt_balls
```

There exists an $n$ such that $x_n \in B_\epsilon(x)$ and $y_n \in B_\epsilon(y)$

But then $x_n > y_n$, a contradiction

````

In words: "Weak inequalities are preserved under limits"

Here's another property of limits, called the "squeeze theorem"

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Let $\{x_n\}$ $\{y_n\}$ and $\{z_n\}$ be sequences in $\mathbb{R}$. If

%
1. $x_n \leq y_n \leq z_n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$
9. $x_n \to a$ and $z_n \to a$
%
then $y_n \to a$ also holds
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Pick any $\epsilon > 0$  

We can choose an 
%
- $N_x \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \geq N_x \implies x_n \in B_\epsilon(a)$
- $N_z \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \geq N_z \implies z_n \in B_\epsilon(a)$
%

**Exercise:** Show that $n \geq \max\{N_x, N_z\} \implies y_n \in B_\epsilon(a)$ 

````

### Cauchy sequences

Informal definition: Cauchy sequences are those where $|x_n - x_{n+1}|$ gets smaller and smaller 

```{figure} _static/plots/cauchy.png

Sequences generated by iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations often have this property

    '''Newton method for solving equation f(x)=0
    with given tolerance and number of iterations.
    Callback function is invoked at each iteration if given.
    '''
    for i in range(maxiter):
        x1 = x0 - fun(x0)/grad(x0)
        err = abs(x1-x0)
        if callback != None: callback(err=err,x0=x0,x1=x1,iter=i)
        if err<tol: break
        x0 = x1
    else:
        raise RuntimeError('Failed to converge in %d iterations'%maxiter)
    return (x0+x1)/2

def print_err(iter,err,**kwargs):
    x = kwargs['x'] if 'x' in kwargs.keys() else kwargs['x0']
    print('{:4d}:  x = {:14.8f}    diff = {:14.10f}'.format(iter,x,err))

print('Newton method')
res = newton(f,g,x0=123.45,callback=print_err,tol=1e-10)

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A sequence $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ is called **Cauchy** if
% 
$$
\forall \; \epsilon > 0, \;\; \exists \; N \in \mathbb{N} 
\; \mathrm{such\;that}\;  n, m \geq N \implies \| {\bf x}_n - {\bf x}_m \| < \epsilon
$$
%
```

Cauchy sequences allow to establish convergence without finding the limit itself!


```{admonition} Definition
:class: important
:name: cauchy

A sequence $\{x_n\}$ is called **Cauchy** if 
$\forall \; \epsilon > 0, \;\; \exists \; N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
%
$$
n \geq N 
\text{ and } \forall j \geq 1 \;\; 
\implies |x_n - x_{n+j}| < \epsilon
$$
%
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$\{x_n\}$ defined by $x_n = \alpha^n$ where $\alpha \in
(0, 1)$ is Cauchy
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

For any $n , j$ we have
%
$$
|x_n - x_{n+j}|
= |\alpha^n - \alpha^{n+j}| 
= \alpha^n |1 - \alpha^j|  \leq \alpha^n
$$
%

Fix $\epsilon > 0$

We can show that $n > \log(\epsilon) / \log(\alpha) \implies \alpha^n < \epsilon$

Hence any integer $N > \log(\epsilon) / \log(\alpha)$ the sequence is Cauchy by definition.

````

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Convergent sequence $\iff$ Cauchy sequence
```
````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Proof of $\implies$: 

Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence converging to some $a \in \mathbb{R}$

Fix $\epsilon > 0$

We can choose $N$ s.t. 
%
$$
n \geq N \;\; \implies \;\; |x_n - a | < \frac{\epsilon}{2} 
$$
%

For this $N$ we have $n \geq N$ and $j \geq 1$ implies
%
$$
|x_n - x_{n+j}|
\leq |x_n - a| + |x_{n+j} - a|
< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon
$$

Proof of $\Leftarrow$:

This is basically an **axiom** in the definition of $\mathbb{R}$  

Either
%
1. We assume it, or

### Subsequences

<!-- - every sequence has a monotone subsequence
- Boltzanno-Weierstrass theorem -->

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A sequence $\{x_{n_k} \}$ is called a **subsequence** of $\{x_n\}$ if 
%
1. $\{x_{n_k} \}$ is a subset of $\{x_n\}$
9. the indices $n_k$ are strictly increasing

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

%
$$
\{x_n\} = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, \ldots\} 
$$
%
$$
\{x_{n_k}\} = \{x_2, x_4, x_6, x_8 \ldots\} 
$$
%
```

In this case
%
$$
\{n_k\} = \{n_1, n_2, n_3, \ldots\} = \{2, 4, 6, \ldots\}
$$
%

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$\{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{5},\ldots\}$ is a
subsequence of $\{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots\}$

$\{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3},\ldots\}$ is a
subsequence of $\{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots\}$

$\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2},\ldots\}$ is **not** a
subsequence of $\{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots\}$
 
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Every sequence has a monotone subsequence
```

Proof omitted

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

The sequence $x_n = (-1)^n$ has monotone subsequence 
%
$$
\{x_2, x_4, x_6, \ldots \}
= \{1, 1, 1, \ldots \}
$$
%
```

This leads us to the famous **Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem**,
to be used later when we discuss optimization.

```{admonition} Fact: Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem
:class: important

Every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a convergent subsequence
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Let $\{x_n\}$ be a bounded sequence

There exists a monotone subsequence

- which is itself a bounded sequence  (why?)
- and hence both monotone and bounded

Every bounded monotone sequence converges

Hence $\{x_n\}$ has a convergent subsequence

````


```{admonition} Definition

A sequence $\{{\bf x}_{n_k} \}$ is called a **subsequence** of $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ if

1. $\{{\bf x}_{n_k} \}$ is a subset of $\{{\bf x}_n\}$
9. the indices $n_k$ are strictly increasing

## Open and closed sets


Let $G \subset \mathbb{R}^N$

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

We call ${\bf x} \in G$ **interior** to $G$ if 
$\exists \; \epsilon > 0$ with $B_\epsilon({\bf x}) \subset G$

```

Loosely speaking, interior means "not on the boundary"

```{figure} _static/plots/interior.png
:name: interior
:scale: 50%
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

If $G = (a, b)$ for some $a < b$, then any $x \in (a, b)$ is interior 
```
```{figure} _static/plots/x_interior.png
:name: x_interior
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Fix any $a < b$ and any $x \in (a, b)$

Let $\epsilon := \min\{x - a, b - x\}$

If $y \in B_\epsilon(x)$ then $y < b$ because 
%
$$
y 
= y + x - x
\leq |y - x| + x
< \epsilon + x 
\leq b - x + x = b
$$
%
**Exercise:** Show $y \in B_\epsilon(x) \implies y > a$

````

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

If $G = [-1, 1]$, then $1$ is not interior 
```

```{figure} _static/plots/not_interior.png
:name: not_interior
```

Intuitively, any $\epsilon$-ball centered on $1$ will contain points $> 1$

More formally, pick any $\epsilon  > 0$ and consider $B_\epsilon(1)$

There exists a $y \in B_\epsilon(1)$ such that $y \notin [-1, 1]$

For example, consider the point $y := 1 + \epsilon/2$

**Exercise:** Check this point: lies in $B_\epsilon(1)$ but not in $[-1, 1]$

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution
:name: open-sets

A set $G\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is called **open** if all of its points are interior 

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Open sets:

- any "open" interval $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$, since we showed all points are interior
- any "open" ball $B_\epsilon({\bf a}) = {\bf x} \in
\mathbb{R}^N : \|{\bf x} - {\bf a} \| < \epsilon$
- $\mathbb{R}^N$ itself
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Sets that are not open

- $(a,b]$ because $b$ is not interior 
- $[a,b)$ because $a$ is not interior 
```

### Closed Sets

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution
:name: closed-sets

A set $F \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is called **closed** if every convergent sequence in $F$ converges to a point in $F$

```

Rephrased: If $\{{\bf x}_n\} \subset F$ and ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$ for some
${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$, then ${\bf x} \in F$

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

All of $\mathbb{R}^N$ is closed because every sequence converging to a point in $\mathbb{R}^N$ converges to a point in $\mathbb{R}^N$... right?
```

```{admonition} Example

If $(-1, 1) \subset \mathbb{R}$ is **not** closed
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

True because
%
1. $x_n := 1-1/n$ is a sequence in $(-1, 1)$ converging to $1$,
9. and yet $1 \notin (-1, 1)$

````

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

If $F = [a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ then $F$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}$

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Take any sequence $\{x_n\}$ such that
%
- $x_n \in F$ for all $n$
- $x_n \to x$ for some $x \in \mathbb{R}$

We claim that $x \in F$

Recall that (weak) inequalities are preserved under limits:

- $x_n \leq b$ for all $n$ and $x_n \to x$, so $x \leq b$
- $x_n \geq a$ for all $n$ and $x_n \to x$, so $x \geq a$
%
therefore $x \in [a, b] =: F$

````

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Any "hyperplane" of the form 
%
$$
H = \{ {\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N : {\bf x}' {\bf a} = c \}

Let $\{{\bf x}_n\} \subset H$ with ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$

We claim that ${\bf x} \in H$

Since ${\bf x}_n \in H$ and ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$ we have 
%
$$
{\bf x}_n ' {\bf a} \to {\bf x}' {\bf a} \text{ in } \mathbb{R}
\quad \text{and} \quad
{\bf x}_n' {\bf a} = c \text{ for all } n

### Properties of Open and Closed Sets

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

$G \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is open $\iff \; G^c$ is closed
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

$\implies$ 

First prove necessity

Pick any $G$ and let $F := G^c$

Suppose to the contrary that $G$ is open but $F$ is not closed, so 
%
$\exists$ a sequence $\{{\bf x}_n\} \subset F$ with limit ${\bf x} \notin F$ 

Then ${\bf x} \in G$, and since $G$ open, $\exists \, \epsilon > 0$ such
that $B_\epsilon({\bf x}) \subset G$

Since ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$ we can choose an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with ${\bf x}_N \in
B_\epsilon({\bf x})$

This contradicts ${\bf x}_n \in F$ for all $n$

$\Longleftarrow$ 

Next prove sufficiency

Pick any closed $F$ and let $G := F^c$, need to prove that $G$ is open

Suppose to the contrary that $G$ is not open

Then exists some non-interior ${\bf x} \in G$, that is no $\epsilon$-ball around $x$ lies entirely in $G$

Then it is possible to find a sequence $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ which converges to $x \in G$, but every element of which lies in the $B_{1/n}({\bf x}) \cap F$

This contradicts the fact that $F$ is closed
````


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Any singleton $\{ {\bf x} \} \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is closed
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Let's prove this by showing that $\{{\bf x}\}^c$ is open

Pick any ${\bf y} \in \{{\bf x}\}^c$

We claim that ${\bf y}$ is interior to $\{{\bf x}\}^c$

Since ${\bf y} \in \{{\bf x}\}^c$ it must be that ${\bf y} \ne {\bf x}$

Therefore, exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $B_\epsilon({\bf y}) \cap B_\epsilon({\bf x}) = \varnothing$

In particular, ${\bf x} \notin B_\epsilon({\bf y})$, and hence $B_\epsilon({\bf y}) \subset \{{\bf x}\}^c$

Therefore ${\bf y}$ is interior as claimed

Since ${\bf y}$ was arbitrary it follows that $\{{\bf x}\}^c$ is open and $\{{\bf x}\}$ is closed

````


```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

1. Any *union* of open sets is open
9. Any *intersection* of closed sets is closed
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown


*Proof of first fact:*

Let $G := \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} G_\lambda$, where each $G_\lambda$ is
open

We claim that any given ${\bf x} \in G$ is interior to $G$

Pick any ${\bf x} \in G$

By definition, ${\bf x} \in G_\lambda$ for some $\lambda$

Since $G_\lambda$ is open, $\exists \, \epsilon > 0$ such that $B_\epsilon({\bf x})
\subset G_\lambda$

But $G_\lambda \subset G$, so $B_\epsilon({\bf x}) \subset G$ also holds

In other words, ${\bf x}$ is interior to $G$ 

````

But be careful:  

- An **infinite** intersection of open sets is not necessarily open
- An **infinite** union of closed sets is not necessarily closed

For example, if $G_n := (-1/n, 1/n)$,  then $\cap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} G_n = \{0\} $  

To see this, suppose that $x \in \cap_n G_n$

Then
%
$$
-1/n < x < 1/n, \quad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
$$
%
Therefore $x = 0$, and hence $x \in \{0\}$  

On the other hand, if $x \in \{0\}$ then $x \in \cap_n G_n$

```{admonition} Fact
 :class: important

If $A$ is closed and bounded then every sequence in
$A$ has a subsequence which converges to a point of $A$
``` 


Take any sequence $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ contained in $A$

Since $A$ is bounded, $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ is bounded

Therefore it has a convergent subsequence

Since the subsequence is also contained in $A$, 
and $A$ is closed, the limit must lie in $A$.

## Continuity

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A function $F$ is called **bounded** if its range is a bounded set.

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $F$ and $G$ are bounded, then so are $F+G$, $F \cdot G$ and $\alpha F$ for any finite $\alpha$
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown


Proof for the case $F + G$:

Let $F$ and $G$ be bounded functions 

$\exists$ $M_F$ and $M_G$ s.t.
$\| F({\bf x}) \| \leq M_F$ and $\| G({\bf x}) \| \leq M_G$
for all ${\bf x}$

Fix any ${\bf x}$ and let $M := M_F + M_G$ 

Applying the triangle inequality gives
%
$$
\| (F + G)({\bf x}) \|
:= \| F({\bf x}) + G({\bf x}) \|
\leq \| F({\bf x}) \| + \| G({\bf x}) \| 
\leq M
$$
%
Since ${\bf x}$ was arbitrary this bound holds for all ${\bf x}$

````


Let $F \colon A \to \mathbb{R}^J$ where $A$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$

Some functions known to be continuous on their domains:

Let $F$ and $G$ be functions and let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$

%
1. If $F$ and $G$ are continuous at ${\bf x}$ then so is $F + G$,
where
%
$$
(F + G)({\bf x}) := F({\bf x}) + G({\bf x})
$$
%

2. If $F$ is continuous at ${\bf x}$ then so is $\alpha F$, where
%
$$
(\alpha F)({\bf x}) := \alpha F({\bf x})
$$
%

3. If $F$ and $G$ are continuous at ${\bf x}$ and real valued then so is
$F \circ G$, where

By assumption, $F({\bf x}_n) \to F({\bf x})$ and $G({\bf x}_n) \to G({\bf x})$

From this and the triangle inequality we get
%
$$
\| F({\bf x}_n) + G({\bf x}_n) - (F({\bf x}) + G({\bf x})) \|
\leq 
$$
$$
\leq 
\| F({\bf x}_n) - F({\bf x}) \|
+
\| G({\bf x}_n) - G({\bf x}) \|
\to 0
$$
