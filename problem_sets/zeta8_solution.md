By definition, $\mathrm{rank}({\bf I})$ is equal to the dimension of the span of
its columns. Its columns are the $N$ canonical basis vectors in $\mathbb{R}^N$,
which we know span all of $\mathbb{R}^N$. Hence 
%
$$
\mathrm{rank}({\bf I}) = \dim(\mathbb{R}^N) = N
$$

*Draft of the proof for the second question:*
For the upper triangular matrix start by showing that the columns are linearly independent, and because there are $N$ of them, they span the whole space $\mathbb{R}^N$, thus the expression above applies again, and the rank is $N$.
