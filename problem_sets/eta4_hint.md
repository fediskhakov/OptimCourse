Recall all the involved definitions, in particular that a canonical form of quadratic form is just a linear combination of squares of variables.

The algebraic derivation should aim at completing squares, with the appropriate change of bases to effectively change the variables. For example, an expression $x^2 + 2xy + y^2$ is a square of a variable $z = x+y$, which can be attained after the change of bases with the transition matrix 

$$
T = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \\
T \colon 
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \to 
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ x+y \end{pmatrix}
$$
