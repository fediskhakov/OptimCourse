1. $P$ is `students taking ECON6012 class`, $Q$ is `admitted at ANU`. We have $P \implies Q$ because **all** students satisfying $P$ ($P$ is true) are also satisfying $Q$ ($Q$ is true).
2. It is a true statement: indeed in order to attend a class one has to be admitted at ANU.
3. Converse takes the form $Q \implies P$: All students admitted at ANU are taking ECON6012. Clearly false.
4. Contrapositive is $\neg Q \implies \neg P$: Those not admitted at ANU are not taking ECON6012. This one is again true.
