Yes, $S$ must be a linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^N$. To see this, pick any
${\bf x}$ and ${\bf y}$ in $S$ and any scalars $\alpha, \beta$.
To establish our claim we need to show that ${\bf z} := \alpha {\bf x} +
\beta {\bf y}$ is in $S$. To see that this is so observe that by ($\text{ such that }ar\text{ such that }ar$)
we have ${\bf u} := \alpha{\bf x} \in S$
and ${\bf v} := \beta{\bf y} \in S$. By ($\text{ such that }ar$) we then have ${\bf u} +
{\bf v} \in S$. In other words, ${\bf z} \in S$ as claimed.
