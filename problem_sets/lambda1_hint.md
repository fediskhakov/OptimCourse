1. Write down the Lagrangian function $\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)$
2. Solve the KKT first order conditions to find the stationary points of
 $\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)$ with respect to $x$, together with the non-negativity of KKT multipliers and complimentary slackness conditions
3. Using second order conditions using the subset of binding constraints, check if the stationary points at the boundary are local optima. Similarly, using the second order conditions for the unconstrained problem to investigate the interior stationary points
3. Compare the function values at all identified local optima to find the global one
