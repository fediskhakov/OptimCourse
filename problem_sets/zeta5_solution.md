Let ${\bf x}_i \in S$ and $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{R}$ for $i=1,2,3$. We claim that
%
$$
\alpha_1 {\bf x}_1 +
\alpha_2 {\bf x}_2 +
\alpha_3 {\bf x}_3 
\in S
$$
%
To see this let ${\bf y} := \alpha_1 {\bf x}_1 + \alpha_2 {\bf x}_2$. By the
definition of linear subspaces we know that ${\bf y} \in S$. 
Using the definition of linear subspaces again we have ${\bf y} + \alpha_3
{\bf x}_3 \in S$. Hence the expression above is confirmed.
