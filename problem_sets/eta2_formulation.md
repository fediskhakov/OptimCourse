Give the linear map defined by the following matrix

$$
T =
\begin{pmatrix}
4/3 & -2/3 & 0 \\
-1/3 & 5/3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

perform the following tasks:

1. Find eigenvalues
2. Find at least one eigenvector for each eigenvalue
3. Form a new basis from the normalized eigenvectors
4. Compute the transformation matrix to the new basis
5. Find the matrix $T$ in the new basis
6. Verify that the matrix $T$ is diagonal in the new basis
