For each of the linear maps defined by the following matrices

$$
T_1 =
\begin{pmatrix}
4/3 & -2/3 & 0 \\
-1/3 & 5/3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
T_2 =
\begin{pmatrix}
4 & 0 & 1 \\
-2 & 1 & 0 \\
-2 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

perform the following tasks:

1. Find eigenvalues
2. Find at least one eigenvector for each eigenvalue
3. Form a new basis from the eigenvectors (normalized or not)
4. Compute the transformation matrix to the new basis
5. Find the matrix $T$ in the new basis and verify that it is diagonal
