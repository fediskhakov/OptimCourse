The point $x=0$ is indeed a maximizer, since $f(x) = 1 -|x| \leq 1 = f(0)$ for any $x \in [-1, 1]$ ($|x|=0$ if and only if $x=0$).

It is also a unique maximizer, since no other point is a maximizer (because $1 -|x| < 1$ for any other $x$).

It is an interior maximizer since $0$ is not an end point of $[-1, 1]$.

It is not stationary because $f$ is not differentiable at this point (sketch the graph if you like) and hence cannot satisfy $f'(x)=0$.
