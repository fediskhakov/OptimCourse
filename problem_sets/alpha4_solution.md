1. Assume that $\sqrt{3} = \frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ ad $q$ are whole numbers.
2. Without loss of generality we can choose $p$ and $q$ such that they do not have common factors, otherwise these factors can be cancelled out.
3. Then $\frac{p^2}{q^2} = 3$, and so $3q^2 = p^2 \iff p^2$ is a multiple of 3.
4. All components in [prime decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization) of $p^2$ enter in pairs because it is a square, therefore there must be an even number of 3's in the factorization of $p^2$
$\implies$ $p$ is a multiple of 3 itself.
5. Therefore we can find a whole number $r$ such that $p = 3r$, and substitute to get $3q^2 = 9r^2 \implies q^2 = 3r^2$.
6. Now the same arguments applied to $q$ let us conclude that $q$ is also a multiple of 3.
7. This contradicts our choice of $p$ and $q$ not having common factors! 
8. Therefore our assumption that $\sqrt{3} = \frac{p}{q}$ is false, and thus $\sqrt{3}$ is indeed an irrational number.
