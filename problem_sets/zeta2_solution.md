This is a bit of a trick question, but to solve it you just need to look
carefully at the definitions (as always).

A linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ is
a subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with certain properties. $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a collection of
3-tuples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ where each $x_i$ is a real number. Elements of
$\mathbb{R}^2$ are 2-tuples (pairs), and hence not elements of $\mathbb{R}^3$.

Therefore $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not a subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$, and in particular not a
linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
