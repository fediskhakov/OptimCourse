A firm uses capital and labor to produce output. 
When it employs $k$ units of capital and $\ell$ units of labor, its output is $A k^{\alpha} \ell^{\beta}$ units, where $A$ is a positive number, and $\alpha + \beta < 1$.

The unit price of capital is $r$, and the unit price of labor is $w$; both are non-negative. 
The firm would like to maximize the profits taking the price $p$ of the output as given.

The firm's chief economist *Bob* presented the following formulation of the firm's optimization problem to the CEO *Alice*:

$$
\text{Choose } k, \ell, w \text{ and } r \text{ to maximize } 
p k^{\alpha} \ell^{\beta} - w \ell - r k 
\quad \text{ subject to } \quad
\alpha + \beta < 1
$$

Questions:

1. Is this formulation of the firm's optimization problem correct?
  - What part reflects the revenue?
  - What part reflects the costs?
  - What are the choice variables?
  - Are there any constraints to be taken into account?

2. Right down the problem after *Alice* have updated the formulation.

3. Approach the problem as unconstrained maximization, and follow the steps in the lecture to find find all stationary points (solve the FOCs).

4. Write down second order partial derivatives and verify the shape conditions for the profit function.

5. What is the optimal strategy for the firm? Is the maximizer unique? Why?
