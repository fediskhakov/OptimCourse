This is not always true. For example, if $f(x) = x^2$ and
$g(x) = 4x$, then $g \circ f$ and $f \circ g$ differ. Indeed, if we set
$x=1$, then

$$
(g \circ f)(1) = g(f(1)) = 4(1^2) = 4,
$$

while

$$
(f \circ g)(1) = f(g(1)) = (4 \times 1)^2 = 16.
$$


Hence $g \circ f \not= f \circ g$ as claimed.

:::{note}
Can you think of restrictions on $f$ and $g$ that would make the claim true?
