This is an exercise on necessary and sufficient conditions.
Start with some definitions from geormetry:

- a **quadrilateral** is a planar figure made up of four line segments connected to form a closed shape. Consider only **simple** quadrilaterals without self-intersections.
- a quadrilateral with a pair of parallel sides is called a **trapezoid**
- a quadrilateral with two pais of parallel sides is called a **parallelogram**
- a parallelogram with right angles is called a **rectangle**
- a rectangle with all sides of the same length is called a **square**
- a parallelogram with all sides of the same length is called a **rhombus**

For each of the statements below determine if they are True or False. For those which are False, provide a counterexample.

1. Sufficient condition for a quadrilateral to be a square is for it to be a rhombus.

2. Necessary condition for a quadrilateral to be a square is for it to be a rectangle.

3. Sufficient condition for a quadrilateral to be a rectangle is for it to be a parallelogram.

4. Necessary condition for a quadrilateral to be a rectangle is for it to be a parallelogram.

5. Necessary condition for a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram is for it to be a trapezoid.

6. Sufficient condition for a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram is for it to be a square.

7. Necessary condition for a quadrilateral to be a trapezoid is for it to be a rhombus.

8. Necessary condition for a quadrilateral to be a rectangle is for it to be a trapezoid.

9. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a quadrilateral to be a square are for it to simultaneously be a rectangle and a rhombus.
