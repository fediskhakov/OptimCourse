Use the following notation:

- $T$ trapezoid
- $P$ parallelogram
- $R$ rectangle
- $S$ square
- $B$ rhombus 

Inspecting the conditions in the definitions we have the following implications:

$$
T \impliedby P \impliedby R \impliedby S \implies B \implies P
$$

It is important to stare at these implications and convince your that you agree with each $\implies$ and each $\impliedby$.

Therefore correct answers are

1. False. We don't have $B \implies S$; counterexample is a rhombus without right angles
2. True. We do have $R \impliedby S$
3. False. We don't have $P \implies R$; counterexample is a parallelogram without right angles
4. True. We do have $P \impliedby R$
5. True. We do nave $T \impliedby P$
6. True. We do have $S \implies P$ (through intermediate $R$)
7. False. We do have $B \impliedby T$; counterexample is a trapezoid with bases of different lengths
8. True. We do have $T \impliedby R$ (through intermediate $P$)
9. True. We do have $(R \text{ and } B) \impliedby S$ and $(R \text{ and } B) \implies S$
