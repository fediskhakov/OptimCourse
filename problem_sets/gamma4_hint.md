There are two things implicit in this question.

First, there is an implicit final
sentence here, which is: If yes, prove it.  If no, give a
counterexample.

Second, an equality sign between two functions means
that they are the same function.  Hence to show equality you need to
show that they agree everywhere on the domain.  To show inequality,
you need to give just one point in the domain where the function
values differ.
