To show that $A$ is closed, we need to show that the limit of any sequence
contained in $A$ is also in $A$. To this end,
let $\{{\bf x}_n\}$ be an arbitrary sequence in $A$ coverging to a point
${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^2$.
Since ${\bf x}_n \in A$ for all $n$ we have
${\bf x}_n \geq {\bf 0}$ in the sense of the component-vise vector inequality
and ${\bf x}_n' {\bf p} \leq m$, where ${\bf p} = (p_1, p_2)$.
We need to show that the same is true for ${\bf x}$.

Since ${\bf x}_n \to {\bf x}$, we have
${\bf x}_n' {\bf p} \to {\bf x}' {\bf p}$. Since limits preserve weak
inequalities and ${\bf x}_n' {\bf p} \leq m$ for all $n$, we have
${\bf x}' {\bf p} \leq m$. Hence it remains only to show that ${\bf x} \geq
0$. Again using the fact that weak inequalities are preserved under
limits, combined with ${\bf x}_n \geq {\bf 0}$ for all $n$, gives
${\bf x} \geq {\bf 0}$ as required.
