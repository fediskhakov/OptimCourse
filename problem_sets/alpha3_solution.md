Denote the given number $p$. Simple algebra gives $p = n^3-n = n(n^2-1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$.
For $n = 2,3,\dots$, we conclude that $p$ is a product of three consecutive natural numbers.

It is easy to show that among $k$ consecutive natural numbers at least one is divisible by $k$ (this can be proven by contradiction using the [pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle) and the number of non-zero remainders).

From the above, it follows that at least one number among $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ is divisible by 3, and by considering any subsequence of two elements, at least one number is divisible by 2. Therefore, their product $p$ is divisible by both 2 and 3, that is by 6.
