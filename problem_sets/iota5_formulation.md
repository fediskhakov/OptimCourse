Consider the maximization problem

$$
\max_{c_1, c_2} ( \sqrt c_1 + \beta \sqrt{c_2})
$$

subject to $c_1  \geq 0$, $c_2 \geq 0$ and $p_1 c_1 + p_2 c_2 \leq m$. 
Here $p_1, p_2$ and $m$ are nonnegative constants, and $\beta \in (0, 1)$.

Show that this problem has a solution if and only if $p_1$ and $p_2$ are both
strictly positive.

Solve the problem by substitution and using the tangency (relative slope) condition.
Discuss, which solution approach is easier.
