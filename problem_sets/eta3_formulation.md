Derive canonical equations for the three conic sections in Euclidean space 
by using the properties stated in the definitions for:

- ellipse
- parabola
- hyperbola

For example, for ellipse, assume that the focal points are located at $(c,0)$ and $(-c,0)$, and consider an arbitrary point $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ which satisfies the defining property of the ellipse. Then, simplify the expression to arrive at the canonical equation of the ellipse, and give interpretations for the parameters $(a,b)$.

Perform additional task for each curve:

1. Ellipse: derive expressions for the coordinates of the focal points using standard parameters $a$ and $b$
2. Parabola: explain the geometric meaning of parameter $p$
3. Hyperbola: verify what change of variables leads to the equation $xy=1$ for the same curve
