Find an example of a nonlinear univariate function $f \colon D \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that:

(a) has exactly one maximizer and one minimizer
(b) has has neither a maximizer nor a minimizer
(c) has an infinite number of maximizers and minimizers
(d) has exactly finite number $n$ of maximizers and $n$ minimizers

Remember to define both the function $f(x)$ and its domain $D$ for each case.
