No, these two vectors do not form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$. 

If they did then $\mathbb{R}^3$ would be spanned by just two vectors.  This is impossible.

If two vectors were enough to form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$, then all bases would have to have two elements and the dimension of the space $\mathbb{R}^3$ would have to be equal 2. 
But [we know](https://optim.iskh.me/07.linear_algebra.html#bases-and-dimension) that the set of $N$ canonical basis vectors form the basis in $\mathbb{R}^N$, and thus the dimension of $\mathbb{R}^3$ is equal to 3.
