Compute directional derivative of $f(x,y) = xy^2 + x^3y$ at the point $(4,-2)$ in the direction of the vector $(1/\sqrt{10},3/\sqrt{10})$.

Proceed in two different ways:
- first, using the definition of the directional derivative, write down a function $g \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ of $h$ given as a slice of the original function $f(x,y)$ through the given point in the given direction; then differentiate this function and compute the derivative at $h=0$
- second, use the gradient formula; and verify that the same answer is obtained
