Solve the following constrained maximization problem using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker method. Verify that the found stationary/critical points satisfy the second order conditions.

$$
\begin{array}{c}
f(x,y) = -x^2 \to \max_{x,y} \\
\text {subject to} \\
x^2-y^2-2xy \ge 2,\\
x,y \in \mathbb{R}
\end{array}
$$
