Start with the definitions of the conic section, and formulate the defining geometric properties of each curve.

Example of what needs to be done, for a circle. Using the definition that a circle is the set of points equidistant from a fixed point (center), we derive the canonical equation of the circle $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.

Let a center be situated in the origin. Then, for an arbitrary point $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, the distance from the center is given by the Euclidean norm $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The defining property of the circle is that this distance is constant, and equal to the radius $r$. Therefore, the canonical equation of the circle is

$$
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = r \quad \iff \quad x^2 + y^2 = r^2
$$
