Let ${\bf C}$ be an $N \times K$ matrix, let $z \in \mathbb{R}$ and consider the function
$f$ from $\mathbb{R}^K$ to $\mathbb{R}$ defined by

$$
f({\bf x}) = {\bf x}' {\bf C}' {\bf C} {\bf x} + z
$$

Show that $f$ has a unique minimizer on $\mathbb{R}^K$ if and only if ${\bf C}$
has linearly independent columns.
