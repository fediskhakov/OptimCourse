Let $T$ be as in the question. We need to show that $T {\bf 0} =
{\bf 0}$.
Here's one proof. We know from the definition of scalar
multiplication that $0 {\bf x} = {\bf 0}$ for any vector ${\bf x}$.
Hence, letting ${\bf x}$ and ${\bf y}$ be any vectors in $\mathbb{R}^K$ and
applying the definition of linearity,
%
$$
%
T{\bf 0} = T(0 {\bf x} + 0 {\bf y}) = 0 T{\bf x} + 0 T {\bf y} 
= {\bf 0} + {\bf 0} 
= {\bf 0}
%
$$
