```{note}
As mentioned in the [Class summary](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2024/course/EMET7001/First%20Semester/4098), for all books, **the edition you consult does not matter much**.  The only operational differences will possibly be the organisation of material within the book, and differences in the relevant chapter titles or chapter numbers, or both. 

The references in the class summary and within each lecture will be to the relevant chapters for the edition of each book cited in this bibliography.  The images below, where possible, are for the same editions, but referring to later editions is perfectly fine.
