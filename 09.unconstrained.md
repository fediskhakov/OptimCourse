## An optimization problem

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Consider a (monopolistic) firm that is facing a market demand for its products $D(p) = \alpha + \frac{1}{4\alpha}p^2-p$ and the cost of production $C(q) = \beta q + \delta q^2$.
As usual, $p$ and $q$ denote price and quantity of product, respectively.

To maximize its profit $\pi(p,q) = pq-C(q)$, the firm solves the following *optimization problem*
%
$$
\Pi(\alpha,\beta,\delta) 
= \max_{p,q} \pi(p,q)
= \max_{p,q} \big[ p q - C(q) \big]
\\
\text {subject to}
\\
q = D(p)\\
q \ge 0\\
p > 0
$$
%

Plugging in the functions $D(p)$ and $C(q)$ we have an equivalent formulation
%
$$
\Pi(\alpha,\beta,\delta) 
= \max_{p,q} \big[ (p-\beta) q - \delta q^2 \big]
\\
\text {subject to}
\\
q = \alpha + \frac{1}{4\alpha}p^2-p\\
q \ge 0\\
p > 0
$$
%
```

### Components of the optimization problem

1. **Objective function**: function to be maximized or minimized, also known as *maximand* \
In the example above profit function $\pi(p,q) = pq - C(q)$ to be maximized
2. **Decision/choice variables**: the variables that the agent can control in order to optimize the objective function, also known as *controls*\
In the example above price $p$ and quantity $q$ variables that the firm can choose to maximize its profit
3. **Equality constraints**: restrictions on the choice variables in the form of equalities \
In the example above $q = \alpha + \frac{1}{4\alpha}p^2-p$
4. **Inequality constraints (weak and strict)**: restrictions on the choice variables in the form of inequalities \
In the example above $q \ge 0$ and $p > 0$
6. **Parameters**: the variables that are not controlled by the agent, but affect the objective function and/or constraints \
In the example above $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\delta$ are parameters of the problem
5. **Value function**: the "optimized" value of the objective function as a function of parameters \
In the example above $\Pi(\alpha,\beta,\delta)$ is the value function

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution
:name: general-optimization-problem

The general form of the optimization problem is

%
$$
V(\theta) 
= \max_{x} f(x,\theta)
\\
\text {subject to}
\\
g_i(x,\theta) = 0, \; i\in\{1,\dots,I\}\\
h_j(x,\theta) \le 0, \; j\in\{1,\dots,J\}
$$
%
where:
- $f(x,\theta) \colon \mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^K \to \mathbb{R}$ is an objective function
- $x \in \mathbb{R}^N$ are decision/choice variables
- $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^K$ are parameters
- $g_i(x,\theta) = 0, \; i\in\{1,\dots,I\}$ where $g_i \colon \mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^K \to \mathbb{R}$, are equality constraints
- $h_j(x,\theta) \le 0, \; j\in\{1,\dots,J\}$ where $h_j \colon \mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^K \to \mathbb{R}$, are inequality constraints
- $V(\theta) \colon \mathbb{R}^K \to \mathbb{R}$ is a value function
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

The set of admissible choices (admissible set) contains all the choices that satisfy the constraints of the optimization problem.

```


```{note}
Sometimes the equality constraints are dropped from the definition of the optimization problem, because they can always be represented as a pair of inequality constraints $g_i(x,\theta) \le 0$ and $-g_j(x,\theta) \le 0$
```

```{note}
Note that strict inequality constraints are not present in the definition above, although they may be present in the economic applications. You already know that this has to do with the intention to keep the set of admissible choices closed, such that the solution of the problem (has a better chance to) exist. Sometimes they are added to the definition.
```

```{admonition} A roadmap for formulating an optimization problem (in economics)
:class: tip

1. Determine which variables are choice variables and which are parameters according to what the economic agent has control over

2. Determine whether the optimization problem is a maximization or a minimization problem

3. Determine the objective function of the economic agent (and thus the optimization problem)

4. Determine the constraints of the optimization problem: equality and inequality, paying particular attention to whether inequalities should be strict or weak (the latter has huge implications for the existence of the solution)

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Consider a decision maker who is deciding how to divide the money they have between food and services, bank deposit and buying some crypto.
Discuss and Write down the corresponding optimization problem.
*[class exercise]*
```

### Classes of the optimization problems

1. Static optimization: finite number of choice variables
  - singe instance of choice
  - deterministic finite horizon dynamic choice models can be represented as static
  - our main focus in this course

2. Dynamic programming: some choice variables are infinite sequences, solved using similar techniques as static optimization 
  - will touch upon in the end of the course

3. Deterministic optimal control: some "choice variables" are functions, completely new theory is needed

3. Stochastic optimal control: "choice variables" are functions, objective function is a *stochastic process*, yet more theory is needed

## Review of one-dimensional optimization

Let $f \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function

- $f$ takes $x \in [a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ and returns number $f(x)$ 
- derivative $f'(x)$ exists for all $x$ with $a < x < b$

Differentiability implies that $f$ is continuous, and because the interval $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded, $f$ has a maximum and a minimum on $[a,b]$ by the Weierstrass extreme value theorem.

```{admonition} Reminder of definitions
:class: caution

A  point $x^* \in [a, b]$ is called a 
- ***maximizer*** of $f$ on $[a, b]$ if $f(x^*) \geq f(x)$ for all $x \in [a,b]$
- ***minimizer*** of $f$ on $[a, b]$ if $f(x^*) \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in [a,b]$

Point  $x$ is called ***interior*** to $[a, b]$ if $a < x < b$ 

A ***stationary point*** of $f$ on $[a, b]$ is an interior point $x$ with $f'(x) = 0$
```

```{figure} _static/plots/stationary.png
:width: 80%
:align: center

Both $x^*$ and $x^{**}$ are stationary
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $f$ is differentiable and $x^*$ is either an interior minimizer
or an interior maximizer of $f$ on $[a, b]$, then $x^*$ is stationary
```

$\Rightarrow$ any interior maximizer stationary\
$\Rightarrow$ set of interior maximizers $\subset$ set of stationary points\
$\Rightarrow$ maximizers $\subset \text{stationary points} \cup \{a\} \cup \{b\}$


Algorithm for finding maximizers/minimizers:
1. Locate stationary points 
2. Evaluate $y = f(x)$ for each stationary $x$ and for $a$, $b$
3. Pick point giving largest $y$ value

### Sufficiency and uniqueness with shape conditions

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Sufficient conditions for *concavity* in one dimension

Let $f \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$
- If $f''(x) \leq 0$ for all $x \in (a, b)$ then $f$ is concave on $(a, b)$

- If $f''(x) < 0$ for all $x \in (a, b)$ then $f$ is **strictly** concave on $(a, b)$

Sufficient conditions for *convexity* in one dimension

Let $f \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$
- If $f''(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in (a, b)$ then $f$ is convex on $(a, b)$
- If $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \in (a, b)$ then $f$ is **strictly**
convex on $(a, b)$
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

For maximizers:
- If $f \colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is *concave* and $x^* \in (a, b)$ is
stationary then $x^*$ is a maximizer
- If, in addition, $f$ is *strictly concave*, then $x^*$ is the
unique maximizer

For minimizers:
- If $f \colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is *convex* and $x^* \in (a, b)$ is
stationary then $x^*$ is a minimizer
- If, in addition, $f$ is *strictly convex*, then $x^*$ is the
unique minimizer
```

Let us generalize these results to the multivariate case.


(ref-foc)=
## First oder conditions (FOC), necessary

In this lecture we focus on the *unconstrained* optimization problems of the form
%
$$
\max_{x} f(x,\theta) \text{ also written as } f(x,\theta) \rightarrow \max,\\
\min_{x} f(x,\theta) \text{ also written as } f(x,\theta) \rightarrow \min,
$$
where $f(x,\theta) \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ and unless stated otherwise is assumed to be continuous and twice continuously differentiable everywhere on $\mathbb{R}^N$.
Parameter $\theta$ may or may not be present.

```{note}
Twice continuously differentiable functions are said to be $C^2$.
```

- Every point in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^N$ is interior, therefore all maximizers/minimizers have to be stationary points

- Assuming differentiability implies we can focus on derivative based conditions

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Given a function $f \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$, a point ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is called a ***stationary point*** of $f$ if $\nabla f({\bf x}) = {\bf 0}$
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Given a function $f \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$, a point ${\bf x^\star} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is called a ***local maximizer/minimizer*** of $f$ if $\exists \epsilon$ such that $f({\bf x}) \le f({\bf x^\star})$ for all $x \in B_{\epsilon}({\bf x^\star})$

If the inequality is strict, then ${\bf x^\star}$ is called a ***strict*** local maximizer/minimizer of $f$
```


A maximizer/minimizer (global) must also be a local one, but the opposite is not necessarily true.

```{admonition} Fact (Necessary condition for optima)
:class: important

Let $f(x,\theta) \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function and let ${\bf x^\star} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ be a local maximizer/minimizer of $f$.

Then ${\bf x^\star}$ is a stationary point of $f$, that is $\nabla f({\bf x^\star}) = {\bf 0}$
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Consider quadratic form $f({\bf x}) = {\bf x}' A {\bf x}$ where 
$A =
\left( 
\begin{array}{rr}
1,& 0.5 \\
0.5,& 2
\end{array}
\right)$
%
Solving the FOC
%
$$
\nabla f({\bf x}) = 2 {\bf x}' A = 0 \implies {\bf x} = {\bf 0}
$$
%
The point $(0,0)$ should be an optimizer.

- This is an example of a **saddle point** where the FOC hold, yet the point is not a local maximizer/minimizer!

- Similar to $x=0$ in $f(x) = x^3$: derivative is zero, yet the point is not an optimizer

- How to distinguish saddle points from optima? Key insight: the function has different second order derivatives in different directions!

## Second order conditions (SOC)

- allow to establish whether the stationary point is a local maximizer/minimizer or a saddle point
- help to determine whether an optimizer is a maximizer or a minimizer
- do not give definitive answer in all cases, unfortunately

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Let $A$ be a $N \times N$ symmetric matrix. It is called

- ***positive definite*** if ${\bf x}' {\bf A} {\bf x} > 0$ for all ${\bf x}
\in \mathbb{R}^N$ with ${\bf x} \ne {\bf 0}$

- ***nonnegative definite*** (or ***positive semi-definite***) if ${\bf x}' {\bf A} {\bf x} \geq 0$
for all ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ 

- ***negative definite*** if ${\bf x}' {\bf A} {\bf x} < 0$ for all ${\bf x}
\in \mathbb{R}^N$ with ${\bf x} \ne {\bf 0}$

- ***nonpositive definite*** (or ***negative semi-definite***) if ${\bf x}' {\bf A} {\bf x} \leq 0$
for all ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$

```

```{admonition} Fact (necessary SOC)
:class: important
:name: necessary-soc

Let $f(x) \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ be a twice continuously differentiable function and let ${\bf x^\star} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ be a local maximizer/minimizer of $f$. Then:

- $f$ has a local maximum at ${\bf x^\star} \implies Hf({\bf x^\star})$ is negative semi-definite
- $f$ has a local minimum at ${\bf x^\star} \implies Hf({\bf x^\star})$ is positive semi-definite

```

```{admonition} Fact (sufficient SOC)
:class: important
:name: sufficient-soc

Let $f(x) \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ be a twice continuously differentiable function.
Then:

- if for some ${\bf x^\star} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ $\nabla f({\bf x^\star}) = {\bf 0}$ (FOC satisfied) and 
$Hf({\bf x^\star})$ is negative definite, then ${\bf x^\star}$ is a **strict local maximum** of $f$

- if for some ${\bf x^\star} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ $\nabla f({\bf x^\star}) = {\bf 0}$ (FOC satisfied) and 
$Hf({\bf x^\star})$ is positive definite, then ${\bf x^\star}$ is a **strict local minimum** of $f$

```

- observe that SOC are only necessary in the "weak" form, but are sufficient in the "strong" form
- this leaves room for ambiguity when we can not arrive at a conclusion --- particular stationary point ***may*** be a local maximum or minimum
- but we can rule out saddle points for sure, in this case neither semi-definiteness nor definiteness can be established, the Hessian is ***indefinite***

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Consider a one dimensional function $f(x) = (x-1)^2$, $\nabla f(x)=2x-2$, $Hf(x) = 2$.

Point $x=1$ is a stationary point where FOC is satisfied.

Treating $Hf(x)$ as $1 \times 1$ matrix, we can see it is positive definite at $x=1$ ($y'[2]y = 2y^2 > 0$ for all $y \ne 0$), therefore $x=1$ ***is a strict local minimum*** of $f$.

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Consider a one dimensional function $f(x) = x^2-1$, $\nabla f(x)=2x$, $Hf(x) = 2$.

Point $x=0$ is a stationary point where FOC is satisfied.

Treating $Hf(x)$ as $1 \times 1$ matrix, we can see it is positive definite at $x=0$ ($y'[2]y = 2y^2 > 0$ for all $y \ne 0$), therefore $x=0$ ***is a strict local minimum*** of $f$.

```


```{admonition} Example

Consider a one dimensional function $f(x) = (x-1)^4$, $\nabla f(x)=4(x-1)^3$, $Hf(x) = 12(x-1)^2$.

Point $x=1$ is a stationary point where FOC is satisfied.

Treating $Hf(x)$ as $1 \times 1$ matrix, we can see it is positive semi-definite (and negative semi-definite) at $x=1$ ($y'[0]y = 0 \ge 0$ and $y'[0]y = 0 \le 0$ for all $y \in \mathbb{R}$), therefore at $x=1$ function $f$ ***may have a local minimum***. But ***may have a local maximum*** as well.
*No definite conclusion!* (In reality it is a local and global minimum)

```

```{admonition} Example

Consider a one dimensional function $f(x) = (x+1)^3$, $\nabla f(x)=3(x+1)^2$, $Hf(x) = 6(x+1)$.

Point $x=-1$ is a stationary point where FOC is satisfied.

Treating $Hf(x)$ as $1 \times 1$ matrix, we can see it is positive semi-definite (and negative semi-definite) at $x=-1$ ($y'[0]y = 0 \ge 0$ and $y'[0]y = 0 \le 0$ for all $y \in \mathbb{R}$), therefore at $x=1$ function $f$ ***may have a local minimum***. But ***may have a local maximum*** as well.
*No definite conclusion!* (In reality it is neither local minimum nor maximum)

```

### Establishing definiteness of Hessian in $\mathbb{R}^2$ case

Recall the following facts from the lecture on linear algebra

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

A symmetric matrix ${\bf A}$ is 
%
- positive definite $\iff$ all eigenvalues are strictly positive

- negative definite $\iff$ all eigenvalues are strictly negative

- nonpositive definite $\iff$ all eigenvalues are nonpositive

- nonnegative definite $\iff$ all eigenvalues are nonnegative

- indefinite $\iff$ there are both positive and negative eigenvalues

```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

For any square matrix ${\bf A}$ 
%
$$
%
\lambda \text{ is an eigenvalue of } {\bf A} \; \iff \;
\det({\bf A} - \lambda {\bf I}) = 0
%
$$
%
```

Let $H$ be a $2 \times 2$ matrix

%
$$
H =
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
a & b \\
c & d \\
\end{array}
\right)
\quad \implies \quad
H - \lambda {\bf I} =
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
a - \lambda & b \\
c & d - \lambda 
\end{array}
\right)
$$
%
$$
\implies
\det(H - \lambda {\bf I}) 
= (a - \lambda)(d - \lambda) - bc
\\
= \lambda^2 - (a + d) \lambda + (ad - bc)
\\
= \lambda^2 - \mathrm{trace}(H) \lambda + \det(H)
$$
%

Hence the the two eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ of $H$ are given by the two roots of 
%
$$
\lambda^2 - \mathrm{trace}(H) \lambda + \det(H)  = 0
$$
%

From the [Viets's formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta%27s_formulas) for a quadratic polynomial we have 
%
$$
\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 = \mathrm{trace}(H) \\
\lambda_1 \lambda_2 = \mathrm{det}(H)
$$
%

Applying this result to a Hessian of a function $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ we have

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important
:name: 2d-soc

Given a twice continuously differentiable function $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ and a stationary point ${\bf x^\star}: \; \nabla f({\bf x^\star}) = {\bf 0}$, the second order conditions provide:

1. if $\mathrm{det}(Hf({\bf x^\star})) > 0$ and $\mathrm{trace}(Hf({\bf x^\star})) > 0$ $\implies$ 
    - $\lambda_1 > 0$ and $\lambda_2 > 0$,

    - undeceive!

4. if $\mathrm{det}(Hf({\bf x^\star})) = 0$ and $\mathrm{trace}(Hf({\bf x^\star})) < 0$ $\implies$ 
    - $\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\lambda_2 < 0$, 
    - $Hf({\bf x^\star})$ is negative semi-definite (nonpositive definite),
    - $f$ may have a local maximum ${\bf x^\star}$
    - undeceive!

5. if $\mathrm{det}(Hf({\bf x^\star})) < 0$
    - $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ have different signs, 
    - $Hf({\bf x^\star})$ is indefinite,
    - ${\bf x^\star}$ is a saddle point of $f$

\nabla f({\bf x})=\big( 2(x_1-1) + x_2^2, \; 2 x_1 x_2 \big), \quad
Hf({\bf x})=
\left(
\begin{array}{ll}
2,& 2 x_2 \\
2 x_2,& 2 x_1 
\end{array}
\right)
$$

Point ${\bf x_1^\star}=(1,0)$ is a stationary point where FOC is satisfied.
%
$$
Hf({\bf x^\star}) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ll}
2,& 0 \\
0,& 2 
\end{array}
\right), \quad
\mathrm{det}(Hf({\bf x^\star})) = 4 > 0, \quad
\mathrm{trace}(Hf({\bf x^\star})) = 4 > 0
$$
%
Therefore at ${\bf x_1^\star}=(1,0)$ function $f$ has a strict local minimum.

Point ${\bf x_2^\star}=(1+\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2},-\sqrt{2})$ is also a stationary point where FOC is satisfied.
%
$$
Hf({\bf x^\star}) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ll}
2,& 2\sqrt{2} \\
2\sqrt{2},& 2-\sqrt{2} 
\end{array}
\right), \quad
\mathrm{det}(Hf({\bf x^\star})) = -4 - 2\sqrt{2} < 0
$$
%
Therefore at ${\bf x_2^\star}=(1,0)$ function $f$ has a saddle point.

Point ${\bf x_3^\star}=(1-\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\sqrt{2})$ is yet another stationary point where FOC is satisfied.
%
$$
Hf({\bf x^\star}) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ll}
2,& -2\sqrt{2} \\
-2\sqrt{2},& 2+\sqrt{2} 
\end{array}
\right), \quad
\mathrm{det}(Hf({\bf x^\star})) =  2\sqrt{2} -4 < 0
$$
%
Therefore again, at ${\bf x_3^\star}=(1,0)$ function $f$ has a saddle point.

## Convexity, sufficiency and uniqueness

A path to globally sufficient conditions for optimality is through establishing the shape of the objective function

- Concave functions $\rightarrow$ local maxima are global maxima
- Convex functions $\rightarrow$ local minima are global minima
- Strict concavity/convexity $\rightarrow$ uniqueness of the maximum/minimum


### Convex functions

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

$f \colon A \subset\mathbb{R}^N \to  \mathbb{R}$ is called ***convex*** if 
$
f(\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y})
\leq \lambda f({\bf x}) + (1 - \lambda) f({\bf y})
$
for all ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in A$ and all $\lambda \in [0, 1]$

$f$ is called ***strictly convex*** if 
$
f(\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y})
< \lambda f({\bf x}) + (1 - \lambda) f({\bf y})
$
for all ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in A$ with ${\bf x} \ne {\bf y}$ and all $\lambda \in (0, 1)$

```

:name: 

A strictly convex function on a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$f({\bf x}) = \|{\bf x}\|$ is convex on $\mathbb{R}^K$ 
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

To see this recall that, by the properties of norms,
%
$$
\|\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y}\|
\leq \|\lambda {\bf x}\| + \|(1 - \lambda) {\bf y}\|
\\
= \lambda \|{\bf x}\| + (1 - \lambda) \|{\bf y}\|
$$
%
That is,
%
$$
%
f(\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y})
\leq 
\lambda f({\bf x}) + (1 - \lambda) f({\bf y})
%
$$
%

````

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If ${\bf A}$ is $K \times K$ and positive definite, then 
$Q({\bf x}) = {\bf x}' {\bf A} {\bf x}, {\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^K$ 
is strictly convex on $\mathbb{R}^K$
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Proof: Fix ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in \mathbb{R}^K$ with ${\bf x} \ne {\bf y}$ and $\lambda \in (0, 1)$

**Exercise:** Show that 
%
$$
%
\lambda Q({\bf x}) + (1 - \lambda) Q({\bf y})
 - Q(\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y})
\\
= \lambda (1 - \lambda) ({\bf x} - {\bf y})' {\bf A} ({\bf x} - {\bf y})
%
$$
%

Since ${\bf x} - {\bf y} \ne {\bf 0}$ and $0 < \lambda < 1$, the right
hand side is $> 0$

Hence
%
$$
%
\lambda Q({\bf x}) + (1 - \lambda) Q({\bf y})
> Q(\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y})
%
$$
%

### Concave Functions

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^K$ be a convex and let $f$ be a function from $A$ to $\mathbb{R}$

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

$f$ is called ***concave*** if 
%
$$
%
f(\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y})
\geq \lambda f({\bf x}) + (1 - \lambda) f({\bf y})
%
$$
%
for all ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in A$ and all $\lambda \in [0, 1]$

$f$ is called ***strictly concave*** if 
%
$$
%
f(\lambda {\bf x} + (1 - \lambda) {\bf y})
> \lambda f({\bf x}) + (1 - \lambda) f({\bf y})
%
$$
%
for all ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in A$ with ${\bf x} \ne {\bf y}$ and all $\lambda \in (0, 1)$

```

**Exercise:** Show that 
%
1. $f$ is concave if and only if $-f$ is convex

9. $f$ is strictly concave if and only if $-f$ is strictly convex

### Hessian based criterion

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important
:name: convexity-hessian-criterion

If $f \colon A \to \mathbb{R}$ is a $C^2$ function where $A \subset \mathbb{R}^K$ is open and convex, then
%
1. $Hf({\bf x})$ positive semi-definite (nonnegative definite) for all ${\bf x} \in A$ $\iff f$ convex
2. $Hf({\bf x})$ negative semi-definite (nonpositive definite) for all ${\bf x} \in A$ $\iff f$ concave

In addition,
%
1. $Hf({\bf x})$ positive definite for all ${\bf x} \in A$ $\implies f$ strictly convex
2. $Hf({\bf x})$ negative definite for all ${\bf x} \in A$ $\implies f$ strictly concave
```

Proof: Omitted

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Let $A := (0, \infty) \times (0, \infty)$ and let $U \colon A \to \mathbb{R}$ be the utility function
%
$$
%
U(c_1, c_2) = \alpha \ln c_1 + \beta \ln c_2
%
$$
%

Assume that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both strictly positive

**Exercise:** Show that the Hessian at ${\bf c} := (c_1, c_2) \in A$ has the form
%
$$
%
H({\bf c})
:=
\begin{pmatrix}
- \frac{\alpha}{c_1^2} & 0 \\
0 & - \frac{\beta}{c_2^2} 
\end{pmatrix}
%
$$
%

**Exercise:** Show that any diagonal matrix with strictly negative elements along
the principle diagonal is negative definite

Conclude that $U$ is strictly concave on $A$
```


### Uniqueness of optimizers


```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^K$ be convex and let $f \colon A \to \mathbb{R}$

1. If $f$ is strictly convex, then $f$ has at most one minimizer on $A$

9. If $f$ is strictly concave, then $f$ has at most one maximizer on $A$

```


Interpretation, strictly concave case:

- we don't know in general if $f$ has a maximizer

- but if it does, then it has exactly one

- in other words, we have uniqueness

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Proof for the case where $f$ is strictly concave:

Suppose to the contrary that 
%
- ${\bf a}$ and ${\bf b}$ are distinct points in $A$

- both are maximizers of $f$ on $A$

By the def of maximizers, $f({\bf a}) \geq f({\bf b})$ and $f({\bf b}) \geq f({\bf a})$

Hence we have $f({\bf a}) = f({\bf b})$

By strict concavity, then
%
$$
%
f\left( \frac{1}{2} {\bf a} + \frac{1}{2} {\bf b} \right)
> \frac{1}{2} f( {\bf a}) + \frac{1}{2} f( {\bf b})
= \frac{1}{2} f( {\bf a}) + \frac{1}{2} f( {\bf a})
= f({\bf a})
%
$$
%

This contradicts the assumption that ${\bf a}$ is a maximizer

````

```{admonition} Fact (sufficient conditions)
:class: important

If $f$ and $A$ are as above and ${\bf x}^* \in A$ is stationary (FOC are satisfied), then
%
1. $f$ strictly concave $\implies$ ${\bf x}^*$ is the unique maximizer of $f$ on $A$
2. $f$ strictly convex $\implies$ ${\bf x}^*$ is the unique minimizer of $f$ on $A$
```

## Roadmap for unconstrained optimization

1. Assuming that the domain of the objective function is the whole space, check that it is continuous and for derivative based methods twice continuously differentiable

2. Derive the gradient and Hessian of the objective function. If it can be shown that the function is globally concave or convex, checking SOC (below) is not necessary, and global optima can be established

3. Find all stationary points by solving FOC

4. Check SOC to determine whether found stationary points are (local) maxima or minima and filter out saddle points

5. Assess whether any of the local optima are global by comparing function values at these points, and inspecting the shape of the function to determine if its value anywhere exceeds the best local optimum (limits at the positive and negative infinities, possible vertical asymptotes, etc.)
