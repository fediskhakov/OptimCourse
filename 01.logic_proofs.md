# ðŸ“– Logic and proofs

## The Wason selection paradox

- Mathematics relies on rules of logic
- Yet, for human brain applying mathematical logic may be difficult, and dependent on the domain

- Peter Cathcart Wason (1924 â€“ 2003)
- cognitive psychologist at University College, London
- pioneered the psychology of reasoning

```{admonition} The Wason selection task
:class: tip

Given four cards showing 3, 8, blue and red faces, which
cards have to be flipped over to ensure the rule
`if card shows even number on one side, the other side is blue`
is satisfied?

Let's play Wason Selection Task at [Mentimeter](https://www.menti.com/alk6yjg64gyf)
```

````{dropdown} Analysis of Wason selection task

- Let $P$ denote `card shows even number on one side`
- Let $Q$ denote `the side is blue`

| Numbver | Color | $P$ | $Q$ | Rule is satisfied | 
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Even | Blue | True | True | Yes |
| Even | Red | True | False | No |
| Odd | Blue | False | True | Yes |
| Odd | Red | False | False | Yes |

- the rule we are checking is $P \implies Q$
- it is only brocken in case $P$ is True and $Q$ is False
- therefore the two cards that have to be flipped are 
    - Even, $P$ is True
    - Red, $Q$ is False

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

$\implies$ denotes **logical implication**:  
If whenever logical statment $P$ is true, $Q$ is also true, we write $P \implies Q$.
```

## Necessary and Sufficient conditions

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

$P$ is a *sufficient condition* for $Q$ means $P \implies Q$  
$P$ is a *necessary condition* for $Q$ means $Q \implies P$, or $P \impliedby Q$
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

$P$ is said to be *if and only if* $Q$ when $P \implies Q$ and $Q \implies P$, 
also written as $P \iff Q$
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$$
x > 3 \implies x^2 >9 \text{ yet converse is not true} \\
x^2 > 9 \iff \{x > 3 \text{ or } x<-3\}
$$

```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A logical statement $P \implies Q$ is *converse* to $Q \implies P$  
A logical statement opposite to $P$ is denoted $\neg P$  
A logical statement $\neg P \implies \neg Q$ is *contrapositive* to $Q \implies P$
```

```{admonition} Fact: Contrapositive principle
:class: important

The statement $P \implies Q$ is equivalent to the statement $(\text{not } Q) \implies (\text{not }P)$:

$$
(P \implies Q) \iff (\neg Q \implies \neg P)
$$

```
```{note}

There is no logical relationship between a statement and its converse!

```


## Types of mathematical proofs

1. **Direct proof**

$A$ is true $\implies$ $B$ is True $\implies$ $S$ is True

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Prove that $p^2-1$ is divisible by 24 for all prime $p>3$.
```

2. **By contradiction**

$$
\left.
\begin{array}{r}
\text{Assume } S \text{ is not True }\\
A \text{ is True}
\end{array}
\right \}
\implies \text{Contradiction} \implies \text{Assumption was wrong} \implies S \text{ is True }
$$

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Prove that the set of prime numbers is unbounded.

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

The standard proof of the infinitude of the primes is attributed to Euclid and uses the fact that all integers greater than 1 have a prime factor.

**Lemma:** Every integer greater than 1 has a prime factor.

*Proof.* We argue by induction (see below) that each integer $n > 1$ has a prime factor. For the base case $n = 2$, 2 is prime and is a factor of itself.

Now assume $n > 2$, all integers greater than 1 and less than $n$ have a prime factor. To show $n$ has a prime factor, we take cases.

*Case 1:* $n$ is prime.
Since $n$ is a factor of itself, $n$ has a prime factor when $n$ is prime.

*Case 2:* $n$ is not prime.
Since $n$ is not prime, it has a factorization $n = ab$ where $1 < a,b < n$. Then by the inductive hypothesis, $a$ has a prime factor, say $p$. Since $p | a$ and $a | n$, also $p | n$ and thus $n$ has prime factor $p$.

**Theorem:** There are infinitely many primes.

*Proof.* (due to Euclid) To show there are infinitely many primes, weâ€™ll show that every finite list of primes is missing a prime number, so the list of all primes canâ€™t be finite.

To begin, there are prime numbers such as 2. Suppose $p_1, \ldots, p_r$ is a finite list of prime numbers. We want to show this is not the full list of the primes. Consider the number

$$
N = p_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_r + 1.
$$

Since $N > 1$, it has a prime factor $p$ by Lemma 2.1. The prime $p$ canâ€™t be any of $p_1, \ldots, p_r$ since $N$ has remainder 1 when divided by each $p_i$. Therefore $p$ is a prime not on our list, so the set of primes canâ€™t be finite.

````

3. **By mathematical induction**

$$
\left.
\begin{array}{r}
S_1 \text{ is True }\\
S_n \text{ is True} \implies S_{n+1} \text{ is True}
\end{array}
\right \}
\implies S_k \text{ is True for all } k=1,2,3,\dots
$$

Prove that $n^3+2n$ is divisible by 3 for all $n=1,2,\dots$
