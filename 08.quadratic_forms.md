## Conic sections

Conic sections are a collection of curves obtained by intersecting a cone with a plane.

An equation describing every conic section is a quadratic equation in two variables.

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A collection of points $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2$, the sum of distances from which to two fixed points (termed foci) is constant, is an ellipse.

When the two foci coincide, the ellipse becomes a circle.

```

```{figure} _static/plots/ellipse.png

:align: center
```

Canonical equation of an ellipse with parameters $a$ and $b$

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
$$

When $a=b$, the ellipse becomes a circle with radius $a=b$.

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Parabola is a collection of points $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ laying at equal distances from a fixed point (focus) and a fixed line (directrix).

```

```{figure} _static/plots/parabola.png
:width: 35%
:align: center
```

Parabola is a section of a cone by a plane parallel to another plane tangential to the conical surface.

Canonical equation of an ellipse with parameters $a$ and $b$

$$
x^2 = 2py
$$

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Hyperbola is a collection of points $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2$, the difference of distances from which to two fixed points (termed foci) is constant.

```

```{figure} _static/plots/hyperbola.png
:width: 35%
:align: center
```

Canonical equation of an ellipse with parameters $a$ and $b$

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
$$

We typically encounter a hyperbola with the equation $y=1/x$ or $yx=1$, but it is easy to show that this is a special case with $a=b$ after a change of basis with transformation matrix given by 
$P=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}1&-1\\1&1\end{pmatrix}$

```{Note}
The highest power of $x$ and $y$ in the equation of a conic section is 2, hence the name *quadratic curves*.
```


## Quadratic forms

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Quadratic form in a function $Q \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ 

$$
Q(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N a_{ij} x_i x_j
$$

```

Note that we can assume that $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$: indeed, if for some quadratic form $\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N c_{ij} x_i x_j$ symmetry does not hold, redefine 

$$
a_{ij} = a_{ji} = \frac{c_{ij}+c_{ji}}{2}
$$

then

$$
\begin{array}{c}
Q(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N a_{ij} x_i x_j = \\
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
a_{11} x_1 x_1 &+& a_{12} x_1 x_2 &+& \ldots &+& a_{1N} x_1 x_N & + \\
a_{21} x_2 x_1 &+& a_{22} x_2 x_2 &+& \ldots &+& a_{2N} x_2 x_N & + \\
\vdots & & \vdots & & \ddots & & \vdots & \\
a_{N1} x_N x_1 &+& a_{N2} x_N x_2 &+& \ldots &+& a_{NN} x_N x_N
\end{array}
= \\
\sum_{i=1}^N a_{ii} x_i^2 + 2 \sum_{i<j} a_{ij} x_i x_j = 
\\
= \sum_{i=1}^N c_{ii} x_i x_i + \sum_{i<j} (c_{ij}+c_{ji}) x_i x_j 
= \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N c_{ij} x_i x_j
\end{array}
$$

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Quadratic form $Q \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$  can be equivalently represented as a matrix product

$$
Q(x) = x^T A x
$$

where $x \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is a column vector, and $(N \times N)$ **symmetric** matrix $A$ consists of elements $\{a_{ij}\}$, $i,j=1,\ldots,N$

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$$
f: \mathbb{R}^3 \ni (x,y,z) \to x^2+3y^2-z^2-4xy+2yz \in \mathbb{R}
$$

has a matrix representation with

$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & -2 & 0 \\
-2 & 3 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

**Exercise:** verify
```

```{Note}
The degree of a quadratic form $Q(x)$ which is a multivariate polynomial function is given by the sum of the powers of the variables, and for quadratic forms is not higher than 2, hence the name *quadratic form*.
This implies that no term of the quadratic form may have a product of more than two variables!
```

> Why are quadratic forms useful in the optimization course?
> 
> Look at the third term in the [multivariate Taylor expansion](https://optim.iskh.me/06.multivariate_calculus.html#multivariate-taylor-series) of a function $f(x) \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$. It is a quadratic form!
> 
> We use quadratic forms for a local approximation of any function, in particular the functions we will want to optimize --- later in the course.



### Canonical form of quadratic forms


```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A canonical form of a quadratic form $Q(x)$ is given by a sum of squares of the variables

$$
Q(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N a_i x_i^2
$$

```


```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

By change of bases any quadratic form $Q(x)$ with a symmetric real matrix $A$ can be transformed to a sum of squares with positive or negative coefficients

$$
Q(x) = x^T A x = x^T P^T D P x = (Px)^T D (Px) = \sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i (Px)_i^2
$$

where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues and $P$ is the matrix of eigenvectors of $A$.

```
````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

It follows from the symmetry of $A$ that it has $N$ real eigenvalues and can be diagonalized with the transformation matrix $P$ composed of eigenvectors.

The change of variable $y = Px$ leads to a transformed quadratic form $Q(y) = y^T D y = \sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i y_i^2$ which contains only squares of the variables.

### Definiteness of quadratic forms

The properties and shape of $Q(x)$ depend on the configuration of matrix $A$

```{figure} _static/plots/qform_pd.png
:width: 50%
:align: center

A convex $Q({\bf x}) = {\bf x}' {\bf I} {\bf x}$ 
```

```{figure} _static/plots/qform_nd.png
:width: 50%
:align: center

A concave $Q({\bf x}) =
{\bf x}'(-{\bf I}){\bf x}$ 
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Quadratic form $Q(x)$ is called **positive definite** if 

$$
Q(x) = x^T A x >0 \text{ for all } x\ne 0
$$

Quadratic form $Q(x)$ is called **negative definite** if 

$$
Q(x) = x^T A x <0 \text{ for all } x\ne 0
$$
```

- the examples above show these cases

- note that because every quadratic form can be represented by a linear combination of squares, the characteristic properties are the **signs** of the coefficients in the canonical form!

```{admonition} Fact (Law of inertia)
:class: important

The number of coefficients of a given sign in the canonical form of a quadratic form does not depend on the choice of the basis
```

- such robust characteristics are called *invariants*
- number of coefficients of a given sign is an invariant of the quadratic form called the **index** of the quadratic form

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Positive and negative definite quadratic forms are called **definite**
```

Note that for some matrices it may be that
- for some $x$: $x^T A x < 0$
- for some $x$: $x^T A x > 0$

In this case $A$ is called ***indefinite***

```{figure} _static/plots/qform_indef.png
:width: 50%
:align: center

Indefinite quadratic function $Q(z) = x_1^2/2 +
8 x_1 x_2 + x_2^2/2$ 
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
Q(x) = x_1^2 + 2 x_2^2 + 1/2 x_3^2 & \text{positive definite} \\
Q(x) = x_1^2 - 2 x_2^2 & \text{indefinite} \\
Q(x) = x_1 x_2 & \text{indefinite} \\
Q(x) = 2 x_1 x_2 - x_1^2 - 4 x_2^2 = -(x_1-x_2)^2 - 3x_2^2 & \text{negative definite} \\
\end{array}
$$
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Quadratic form $Q(x)$ is called **non-negative definite (positive semi-definite)** if 

$$
Q(x) = x^T A x \geqslant 0 \text{ for all } x\ne 0
$$

Quadratic form $Q(x)$ is called **non-positive definite (negative semi-definite)** if 

$$
Q(x) = x^T A x \leqslant 0 \text{ for all } x\ne 0
$$

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
Q(x) = x_1^2 + 2 x_2^2 & \text{positive semi-definite if } x \in \mathbb{R}3\\
Q(x) = x_1^2 + 2x_1 x_2 + x_2^2 & \text{positive semi-definite} \\
\end{array}
$$

In the last example, the points $t(1,-1)$ for any $t \in \mathbb{R}$ yield $Q(x) = 0$
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

A quadratic form $Q(x)$ with a symmetric real matrix $A$ is 

- positive definite $\iff$ all eigenvalues are strictly positive
- negative definite $\iff$ all eigenvalues are strictly negative
- nonpositive definite $\iff$ all eigenvalues are nonpositive
- nonnegative definite $\iff$ all eigenvalues are nonnegative

```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Follows immediately from the diagonalization of $A$
$\blacksquare$
````

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$$
Q(x,y) = 8x^2 - 28xy + 29y^2
$$

$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
8 & -14 \\
-14 & 29
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Let's diagonalize $A$ by finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors

$$
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
8-\lambda & -14 \\
-14 & -29-\lambda
\end{array}
\right| = 
(8-\lambda)(29-\lambda) - 14^2 = 
\lambda^2 - 37\lambda + 36 =0
$$

Eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\lambda_2 = 36$

Eigenvectors are $v_1 = (2,1)$ and $v_2 = (-1,2)$

Transformation matrix is $P = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$

Let $(u,v) = (2x-y,x+2y)$, then the quadratic form can be written as $Q(u,v) = u^2 + 36v^2 >0$ for any $u,v$

Hense, $Q(x)$ is a positive definite

```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If quadratic form $x^TAx$ is positive definite, then $\det(A) > 0$

```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

Positive definite $\iff$ all eigenvalues are strictly positive $\implies$ $det(A)>0$ as the product of eigenvalues.
$\blacksquare$
````

- in particular, $A$ is nonsingular


### Silvester's criterion

Diagonalization of the higher order matrices may be hard. We have an alternative for determining the definiteness of a quadratic form

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Consider a $N \times N$ matrix $A$ and let $0 < k \le N$.

The **leading principal minor** $M_k$ of order $k$ of $A$ is the determinant of a matrix obtained from $A$ by deleting its last $N-k$ rows and columns.

```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$$
A = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{11} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{n1} & \cdots & a_{nn}
\end{array}
\right)
$$
%
The leading principal minors of oder $k = 1,\dots,n$ of $A$ are
%
$$
\begin{array}{l}
M_1 = \mathrm{det}(a_{11}) = a_{11} \\
M_2 = \mathrm{det}\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{array}
\right)
= a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21} \\
M_3 = \mathrm{det}\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{array}
\right)\\
\vdots \\
M_n = \mathrm{det}(A)
\end{array}
$$

```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Let $A$ be an $(N \times N)$ symmetric square matrix.
The corresponding quadratic form $Q(x) = x^T A x$ is
**positive definite** if and only if **all leading principal minors** of $A$ are positive

$$
x^T A x > 0 \text{ for all } x \ne 0 \quad \iff \quad  M_k > 0 \text{ for all } k=1,\ldots,N
$$

Quadratic form $Q(x) = x^T A x$ is
**negative definite** if and only if the leading principal minors of $A$ alternate in sign according to the following rule

$$
x^T A x < 0 \text{ for all } x \ne 0 \quad \iff \quad  (-1)^k M_k >0 \text{ for all } k=1,\ldots,N
$$

```
- the last condition can be restated as the leading principle minor $M_k$ to have the same sign as $(-1)^k$

- if $A$ does not satisfy either of the conditions, it is **indefinite** or **semi-definite**

Silvester's criterion for semi-definiteness is more involved

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Consider a $N \times N$ matrix $A$ and let $0 < k \le N$.

The **principal minor** of order $k$ of $A$ is the determinant of a matrix obtained from $A$ by deleting any of its $N-k$ rows and columns.

```
- observe the difference from the *leading* principal minor

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Let $A$ be an $(N \times N)$ symmetric square matrix.
The corresponding quadratic form $Q(x) = x^T A x$ is
**positive semi-definite** if and only if **all principal minors** of $A$ are positive.

Quadratic form $Q(x) = x^T A x$ is
**negative definite** if and only if the **principal minors** of oder $k$ of $A$ are of the same sign as $(-1)^k$
```
