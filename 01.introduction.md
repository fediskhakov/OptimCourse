# Introduction

Course title: **"Optimization for Economics and Financial Economics"**

- Elective second year course in the *Bachelor of Economics* program ECON2125
- Compulsory second math course in the *Master of Economics* program ECON6012

The two courses are identical in content and assessment, but final grades *may* be adjusted depending on your program.

## Course prerequisites

See [Course overview](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/course/ECON2125#terms) and
[Class summary](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/ECON2125/Second%20Semester/6275)

What you actually need to know:
- basic algebra
- basic calculus
- some idea of what a matrix is, etc.

≈ content of EMET1001/EMET7001 math courses

## Focus?

*Q:* Is this optimization or a general math-econ course?

*A:* Optimization will be an important and recurring theme, but the course has a lot more material on general mathematical modeling for economics.

## How tutorials will be conducted?

- practical exercises 
- posted with the corresponding lecture
- try to solve the exercises before the tutorial
- exercises solved and discussed at the tutorial
- **participation is not mandatory but highly recommended**
- if you solve all tutorial excesses, you will be able to solve all practical problems in the exams
- solutions posted a week after

**Tutorials start on week 2**


## Where to send your questions

1. Administrative questions: RSE admin

    - **Bronwyn Cammack** Senior School Administrator
    - Email: enquiries.rse@anu.edu.au
    - "I can not register for the tutorial group"

2. Content related questions: please, refer to the tutors

    - "I don't understand why this function is convex"

3. Other questions: to Fedor

    - "I'm working hard but still can not keep up"
    - "Can I please have extra assignment for more practice"

## Attendance

- please, **do not** use email for *instructional* questions

- instead make use of the office hours

- attendance of tutorials is *very highly* recommended\
You will make your life much easier this way

- attendance of lectures is *highly* recommended\
But not mandatory

## Lectures notes/slides

- Cover exactly what you are required to know
- Code inserts are the exception, they are not assessable

In particular, you need to know:
- The definitions from the notes
- The facts from the notes
- How to apply facts and definitions

If a concept in not in the lecture notes, it is not assessable

## Assessments

`See root/home page`

## Definitions and facts

The lectures notes/slides are full of definitions and facts.

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is called *continuous at* $x$ if, for any sequence $\{x_n\}$ converging to $x$, we have $f(x_n) \rightarrow f(x)$.
```

Possible exam question: "Show  that if functions $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $x$, so is $f+g$."

You should start the answer with the definition of continuity: 

"Let $\{x_n\}$ be any sequence converging to $x$. We need to show that $f(x_n) + g(x_n) \rightarrow f(x) + g(x)$. To see this, note that ..."

## Facts

In the lecture notes/slides you will often see

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important
The only $N$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^N$ is $\mathbb{R}^N$.
```
This means either:
- theorem
- proposition
- lemma
- true statement

All well known results. You need to remember them, have some intuition for, and be able to apply.

## Note on Assessments

Assessable = definitions and facts + last year level math + a few simple steps of logic

Exams and tests will award:
- Hard work
- Deeper understanding of the concepts

In each question there will be a *easy* path to the solution

## Reading materials

- "Mathematics for Economists" (1994) by Simon, C. and L. Blume
- "A First Course in Optimization" (1996) Theory by Rangarajan Sundaram

`See root/home page`

- readings are supplementary but will provide a more detailed explanation with additional examples.
- each lecture will reference book chapters

## Key action points for the administrative part

- Tutorials start next week, **please register before the next lecture**
- Course content = what’s in lecture notes/slides
- Lecture slides are available online and will be updated throughout the semester
- Optimization is a recurring theme but not the only topic








# Logic and proofs

## The Wason selection paradox

- Mathematics relies on rules of logic
- Yet, for human brain applying mathematical logic may be difficult, and dependent on the domain

```{image} _static/img/wason.png
   :width: 60%
```

- Peter Cathcart Wason (1924 – 2003)
- cognitive psychologist at University College, London
- pioneered the psychology of reasoning

```{admonition} The Wason selection task
:class: tip

Given four cards showing 3, 8, blue and red faces, which
cards have to be flipped over to ensure the rule
`if card shows even number on one side, the other side is blue`
is satisfied?

Let's play Wason Selection Task at [Mentimeter](https://www.menti.com/alk6yjg64gyf)
```

## Analysis of Wason selection task

- Let $P$ denote `card shows even number on one side`
- Let $Q$ denote `the side is blue`

| Numbver | Color | $P$ | $Q$ | Rule is satisfied | 
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Even | Blue | True | True | Yes |
| Even | Red | True | False | No |
| Odd | Blue | False | True | Yes |
| Odd | Red | False | False | Yes |

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

$\implies$ denotes **logical implication**:  
If whenever logical statment $P$ is true, $Q$ is also true, is written $P \implies Q$.
```

- the rule we are checking is $P \implies Q$
- it is only brocken in case $P$ is True and $Q$ is False
- therefore the two cards that have to be flipped are 
    - Even, $P$ is True
    - Red, $Q$ is False

## Necessary and Sufficient conditions

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

$P$ is a *sufficient condition* for $Q$ means $P \implies Q$  
$P$ is a *necessary condition* for $Q$ means $Q \implies P$, or $P \impliedby Q$
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

$P$ is said to be *if and only if* $Q$ when $P \implies Q$ and $Q \implies P$, 
also written as $P \iff Q$
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

$$
x > 3 \implies x^2 >9 \text{ yet converse is not true} \\
x^2 > 9 \iff \{x > 3 \text{ or } x<-3\}
$$

```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A logical statement $P \implies Q$ is *converse* to $Q \implies P$  
A logical statement opposite to $P$ is denoted $\neg P$  
A logical statement $\neg P \implies \neg Q$ is *contrapositive* to $Q \implies P$
```

```{admonition} Fact: Contrapositive principle
:class: important

If statement $P \implies Q$ is equivalent to $\text{not } Q \implies \text{not }P$:
$$
(P \implies Q) \iff (\neg Q \implies \neg P)
$$

```



## Types of mathematical proofs

1. **Direct proof**

$A$ is true $\implies$ $B$ is True $\implies$ $S$ is True

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Prove that $p^2-1$ is divisible by 24 for all prime $p>3$.
```
````{admonition} Proof

````

2. **By contradiction**

$$
\left.
\begin{array}{r}
\text{Assume } S \text{ is not True }\\
A \text{ is True}
\end{array}
\right \}
\implies \text{Contradiction} \implies \text{Assumption was wrong} \implies S \text{ is True }
$$

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Prove that the set of prime numbers is unbounded.
```

````{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

The standard proof of the infinitude of the primes is attributed to Euclid and uses the fact that all integers greater than 1 have a prime factor.

**Lemma:** Every integer greater than 1 has a prime factor.

*Proof.* We argue by (strong) induction that each integer $n > 1$ has a prime factor. For the base case $n = 2$, 2 is prime and is a factor of itself.

Now assume $n > 2$, all integers greater than 1 and less than $n$ have a prime factor. To show $n$ has a prime factor, we take cases.

*Case 1:* $n$ is prime.
Since $n$ is a factor of itself, $n$ has a prime factor when $n$ is prime.

*Case 2:* $n$ is not prime.
Since $n$ is not prime, it has a factorization $n = ab$ where $1 < a,b < n$. Then by the strong inductive hypothesis, $a$ has a prime factor, say $p$. Since $p | a$ and $a | n$, also $p | n$ and thus $n$ has prime factor $p$.

**Theorem:** There are infinitely many primes.

*Proof.* (due to Euclid) To show there are infinitely many primes, we’ll show that every finite list of primes is missing a prime number, so the list of all primes can’t be finite.

To begin, there are prime numbers such as 2. Suppose $p_1, \ldots, p_r$ is a finite list of prime numbers. We want to show this is not the full list of the primes. Consider the number
$$ N = p_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_r + 1. $$
Since $N > 1$, it has a prime factor $p$ by Lemma 2.1. The prime $p$ can’t be any of $p_1, \ldots, p_r$ since $N$ has remainder 1 when divided by each $p_i$. Therefore $p$ is a prime not on our list, so the set of primes can’t be finite.

3. **By mathematical induction**

$$
\left.
\begin{array}{r}
S_1 \text{ is True }\\
S_n \text{ is True} \implies S_{n+1} \text{ is True}
\end{array}
\right \}
\implies S_k \text{ is True for all } k=1,2,3,\dots
$$

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Prove that $n^3+2b$ is divisible by 3 for all $n=1,2,\dots$
