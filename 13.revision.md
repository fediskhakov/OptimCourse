## Most involved problem from the previous exam

::::::{tab-set}
:::::{tab-item} Formulation

  Find the maximizers of the function $f \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ 
  given by 
  
  $$
  f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2
  $$
  
  on the set 

  $$
  D = \{(x,y) \colon (y+1)^3 \ge x^2 \text{ and } x^2+y \le 1\}
  $$

  Use first and second order conditions to support your answer
